My implementation of a movie recommendation chatbot.

Ever been bored and longing to find a movie to watch? This chatbot is your perfect solution! 

This chatbot asks the user for their opinion about  a few movies of their choice, and recommends 10 movies accordingly. I based my implementation of this chatbot on the CS124 NLP course which I audited at Stanford University in Spring 2021. The entire implementation is in Python 3.
