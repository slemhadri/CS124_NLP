a cheaper choice but the service is absolutely horrid the people who work for them are absolutely rude and they dont care if they make you miss your flight and in the process cost you 1000 dollars in changing the flight the lady who was in charge of checking in the baggage treated us like the scum of the earth she was rude and sarcastic utterly one of the worst experiences of customer service ive ever had in my life we tried talking to different people on the floor and we were treated with the same rude treatment we asked to speak with the supervisor and they kept putting us off and we waited 2 hours for the supervisor and we had to beg for her to put us on a flight for our family thats on wednesday extending our trip 2 days and causing my mother to miss 2 days at work and my sister 2 days of school and delaying my packing for my apartment this is absolutely the worst flight experience of my life with this airline only to add that on my way here my flight was delayed by 5 hours and was i compensated of course not because that would be god forbid good customer service although volar is did me the great favor of charging me 1000 because the lady in front of me was taking 30 minutes to check on additional baggage and then they closed the flight for my family but they sure let the lady in front onto the plane and then proceeded to treat us extremely horribly i am utterly disgusted by the treatment i have received with this airline and i highly recommend you fly another airline to avoid yourself having a horrid experience like my family underwent|0
babes is a very spacious bar with a lot of tables but heaps of bar stools too the bar snakes through the whole backside so you have a good view of the whole establishment they also have a large patio i was here for a fundraiser and the pizza they served was fantastic the service was also excellent our bartender came out from behind the bar to our table many times to see if we needed anything else she was also attentive to clearing our empties a few times people at our table asked for different to stations to be put on and it wasnt a big deal|1
i have been taking the intro to natural childbirth class at come i am very pleased with the class the teacher is great and the classes are very informative i can not believe they offer these classes for free either the facility itself is also very nice and clean and right off highway 77 so it is easy to get to i am delivering at a hospital but i would definitely look at come as an option in the future|1
i think italian ice is a stretch based on what i grew up eating on the east coast that said i came for the custard which is pretty good two stars though is because the floor was so sticky it felt like it hadnt been mopped in a week and every table in the place had something spilled and left on it for a while even the ones outside i attribute it to the two teenage boys running the place tonight having a teenage boy i understand just how oblivious they can be to things like cleaning|0
in my view in the us there are generally three types of sushi places the very small packed place that has the run of the mill sushi the convert belt sushi or the fancy schmancy type with renamed sushi rolls and a few not so common in my view ko fusion is at least this location is the fancy schmancy type and the prices to go with it nonetheless they have some unique rolls and have more than just sushi so if you have friends who are adverse to raw seafood theyll be able to find items such as hibachi chicken or beef along with rice or noodle dishes the service was just okay for as few people there were at the time we visited i felt the service could have been far better my suspicion is the kid was nursing a hangover but he was friendly and he did get our order right as with most sushi places when the two platters of sushi rolls came to the table they presented well and certainly there was pride in the work the rolls were nice and tight and didnt fall apart from plate to mouth the fish especially the salmon was very fresh and i liked the special sauce used on the spicy tuna i would certainly come back here again although if youve not been to the mongolian place just up the road i would suggest giving that a try too both places are excellent one other point if you happen to be over by the collage there is a small ko fusion place by the music hall ive not been there myself but just thought id mention it so you didnt trek through congested roads|1
although arm is i think did a an ok job with my color she was very rude to me its the worst customer service i have ever received in a salon the place was empty and she kept me waiting for 20 minutes after my appointment was supposed to start the receptionist before walking out during her shift went to get her three times towards the end of the appointment while she was starting to dry and style my hair i had a lot of questions and was trying to explain my look and she basically yelled at me she said she couldnt work like this and let i do my job because i was admiring my hair in the mirror then she implied she remembered me from years ago i suppose saying i was difficult it was the most appalling customer service experience ive ever had the receptionist basically walked out so she kept having to go and greet people during my appointment her credit machine didnt work so she insisted on taking pictures of my card instead of accepting a check or cash from a nearby atm also i had a 50 off 100 coupon but i find it odd that my service quote was 200 before i mentioned the coupon and after the coupon was to be applied i did not want to argue with this woman any longer so i just paid and left the place was dirty and hair from previous cuts was on the ground the paint was chipping on the walls and there were stains horrible experience shes their master stylist and she treated me like garbage|0
this post office excels at incompetence staffed at any given moment by two poorly trained employees who share the work and provide slow unhelpful service every visit here takes far longer than it should and line ups are usually spilling into the pharmacy aisle if you are able to wait in line long enough to send your mail dont expect it to ever arrive at its destination even if that is within the city i keep promising myself that each experience ive had at this miserable excuse of a post office will be my last but it is the only post office in the neighbourhood avoid at all costs|0
if i had seen the star reviews prior to eating i dont think i wouldve checked them out so glad i did i had to make a quick stop at one of the retailers at the outlets during my lunch so lunch had to be short and quick i wasnt starving but boy did their pizza look good fresh out of the oven i decided on a side mac i cheese a garlic roll and a water i loved the mac i cheese and wished i had ordered a larger side it wasnt oozing with cheese but the flavors were really good and the pasta was springy and delicious the garlic roll was very buttery topped with yummy parmesan the water bottle was iced cold the service was excellent and speedy which was just what i needed on that day i would definitely eat there again except a larger side of mac i cheese|1

getting established with tureen was relatively simple the person came and inspected and laid out the entire plan for the year it looked promising as months rolled by the replacement grass turned out to be aesthetically poor i even received a notification from my hoa regarding weeds in my lawn in spite of me giving a feedback to tureen the issue remains unaddressed in fact the previous visit the the agent did not even step his foot in the backyard the local office called me and said will stop by to re inspect and scheduled a two hour block on a wednesday and no showed overall my experience so far with tureen has been truly unprofessional and a total waste of time and money|0
i went to this location with a group on offer for a straightening treatment after doing a single section i noticed my hair color had changed drastically i asked the hair dresser what had happened and she assured me the color would not change as much as i thought she completed the rest of my hair and the process made my hair go from dark black to a light brown blonde she then proceeded to dye my hair twice which did not take by this time my hair was horribly over processed and i was there for 6 hours my appointment started at 100pm and she had even taken on another customer at the same time i was told to return the next day and have her continue to dye my hair i instead went to another salon who let me know any treatment the hair dresser did had been ruined from the dye and multiple rinsing and i had to spend over 200 to get it fixed and was forced to have 23 inches cut off i thankfully got a refund from group on however the salon owner repeatedly harassed my cell phone for days after telling me i had skipped on the bill and sent very rude text messages claiming i had scammed her after a few days i politely told her she had not done what i had gone into the salon for but instead ruined my hair which i had to then have fixed for much more than the treatment was supposed to be initially the text messages stopped immediately i would advise anyone to be very cautious about going to this hair salon|0
i got a group on for exam cleaning and xray waited a month for appointment went in today i had a root canal at another dentist 2 months ago and had a full set of rays i told them that i wanted to skip the rays as not necessary to expose to more radiation yes may be i am a bit neurotic about this they said they couldnt do the cleaning without rays ok can i get you the films from my previous dentist and reschedule as i did not realize i had to get rays for a cleaning they say this is the law ok thats cool but im not familiar with dental law and did not know this and no one said i had to get them when i talked with them scheduling confirming app and no one said send rays from previous dentist over they said they couldnt wait for this ok can i reschedule i ask thats when things get embarrassing the receptionist proceeds to be rate me in front of the waiting room about how they dont make money off group on and they barely cover their costs and they would never reschedule a lowly group on customer such as myself and how they have wasted this time slot already as it could have been filled with an actual paying customer i tell her we all know that group on is to get new customers not make money and i find it offensive that she would even mention this to me and she just basically said sorry not sorry at this point i certainly did not feel comfortable staying and having sharp instruments near my mouth oh and the office reeked like cigarettes which is not a good feel for your dentists office|0
we hired this company to clean our pool on a weekly basis for a number of weeks now the pool looks untouched im mead lately after an employee cleans it when management was contacted instead of being offered some form of solution we were told they are doing the best they can that we should be cleaning it ourselves in between their cleanings that they can not provide the time frame needed to do a proper job and that our pool was bad to begin with when asked why we were never notified of the necessity of additional services to resolve this they have no explaination and when asked for an email address to email photos of their last cleaning to prove how shotty the work has been for weeks they provided us with nothing more than an abrasive attitude their customer service is deplorable their lack of communication is ridiculous and their quality of work is completely unacceptable others have filed complaints with the bob regarding these exact same issues and others have left poor reviews for this company and now we know exactly why other companies weve hired in the past have not had a problem providing ada quite service on a weekly basis nor did they provide such condescending unproductive customer service do not hire these people to clean your pool unless you enjoy loosing money and being pissed off regarding the customer service you receive|0
love this food i had just recently moved away from edgewood and im craving it right now lol i literally lived 2 blocks away from this gem i made it a point to order it every week and try everything on the menu that didnt happen lol i was stuck on the green curry with duck with any buisness though they change prices and certain ways of doing things they used to be a little bit cheaper seems like the change the menu every year so when you order take out its kind of a suprise when you get the total they used to have a rating scale on 110 on how spicy you had wanted your curry that was fun picking that out kinda bummed its gone all in all even with the raise in price this is the best bang for your buck curry quality of food is off the charts and some of the waitresses are really nice and kind of cute lol|1

it has been 2 years since the install and the pool has worked out great marc the owner is good at helping understand upgrades that make sense while cautioning against poor decisions in design and material we had a couple of concerns during the install and it would have been great if marc was more involved at that time but he had a many pools going at once ultimately he was willing to make sure the job was done right and to our satisfaction which we are thankful for|1

beware this company is not nearly as professional as they come across on the phone i hosted a bachelorette party for 10 women we had a battery explode and strand us on the highway in the desert for an hour they offered no other limo made us wait while they disconnected the battery and let it cool down and then we continued to our first destination the blown battery left us with no air conditioning no lighting and no door locks by the end of our 8 hour rental our clothes were drenched several women were suffering heat exhaustion to the point where one was vomiting not from drinking from heat because of the breakdown we missed both reservations at the two wineries we were visiting and had to cut our time at each place the worst part is that the owner brent doesnt care when i asked brent for some compensation back because of the inconvenience he wouldnt return any of my calls or texts i tried to dispute with american express and all he would reply was that there were no refunds and they were not responsible for breakdowns in essence he made us responsible for the breakdown by not refunding any money back we paid for a service and an experience and that should have included reliable and comfortable transportation something we definitely didnt get also we found out he has a less than ethical practice of under paying his drivers he finds ways to not pay them the full agreed amount for their hourly pay i will never use them again it is buyer beware to the fullest as brent has no ethics and either doesnt understand customer service or is unwilling to provide it beware your money is a one way trip a risk i will never take with this company feel free to contact me on me if you have any additional questions this is not sour grapes please understand this is an honest attempt to help people understand the low level of integrity of so limos and save them the frustration and time of having to deal with this company make it easy and book somewhere else|0
the flyer was left in my mailbox so i decided to give it a try considering that there is a good pho place pho asia 24 four doors down from hues one would think that they would try a little bit harder to compete pho is supposed to come with sprouts and sauces hues didnt the pho was bland and not very good at all the vegetable rolls were ok but were dripping in oil i understand that they are supposed to be oily but this was over the top they also sell a confusing mix of indian food which if they want to be a vietnamese restaurant the pho should be priority 1 the exterior to the restaurant is beautiful and it really cleans up this area of king it i but if you are looking for pho i would suggest eating elsewhere|0

so im new to the area and i need batteries for 3 watches 2 tags and a citizen i found a coupon for a free regular watch battery at fri ej jewelers online well we all know most of the time there is a catch and free might actually mean just tax just labor whatever but still i had three watches and may be i would get one for battery free so i get there and the man who i assume is the owner sees the coupon and immediately gives me the stink eye i show him the watches a he says well these need a tag batteries whata i i ask tag makes special batteries no he says but you dont put cheap batteries in such quality watches unless you want to ruin them and then he said i dont care what you do their not my watches ok so wait how much are these special better batteries he says 2500 each but since i have a coupon hell do it for 20 each gee thanks i fi guide ok im here fine whatever he looks at my other watch the less impressive citizen and tells me it will have to go to the factory for service to replace the battery as it is a eco drive ok these are my watches and i should know more about them or at least at a minimum what they are or do i admit i may not work to care enough about certain things as he is putting the battery in the first tag he stops and says that its not working and there is water in the case but not to worry he can fix it for 18000 if its just the gears i ask if its not just the gears he says dont worry ill help you out later on these words will paint a much different definition of the word help i ask him to just put a battery in the other tag watch and ill talk to my wife about what she wants to do about the first watch they are both hers he insists the first watch isnt working and he doesnt even want to put the back cap back on beacause it will rust and ruin it ultimately he kindly offers to do the work and i can pick it up when i have the money now i was raised if you can pay for it then do it but im not going to risk losing the watch in case he comes up with some crazy amount that the work cost nope not goanna do it i ask him to put the watch in a bag he does and he puts the battery in the other watch and charges me 20 thats the deal with the free coupon so i leave now i also found a coupon for gabriel jewelers down the street 399 for a watch battery i take the other two watches the now uncapped tag and the citizen thinking may be they will have a better price for all the work these 2 broken watches need i hand the lady the tag and the coupon she takes it and says one minute takes it to the tech comes back takes my other watch and asks are you sure it broken i answer well no i need a battery from the factory rights he then informs me to just leave it in the light and that recharges the battery huh wait i thought it needed to go to the factory she says if you keep it in the dark in a drawer box etc it runs down its a good idea to put it in the light for hours before you use or wear it and presto it works in fact it started working while i was standing there but wait how can that be it doesnt work at least thats what the man at frei i or my frei i had said she leaves then returns and shows me the tag watch holy smokes its working i ask about the special batteries that for sure this watch needs the look on her face answered that question and the water it not a big deal it will be okay so about 20 minutes before i walked through the door of gabriel i was thinking it would cost 30000 to may be 40000 dollars to ever see these 2 watches working again and that was with the help of my fri ej lucky for me he was so cool to help me out right but some how some way both watches worked and it cost me a whooping 400 for some business or some people times have been tough with the economy or whatever but you know when the business states its been around since 1940 i really thought i wouldnt have to worry about being helped which in this case wasnt helping me but trying to get me to spend money on work that wasnt ness essay and ill say it that way beacause for a business that has been around as long as they have im sure or at least i hope it wasnt always possible for this kind of thing to happen i will not be going back to this store and felt that i should share what happend now i must say he did put the battery in the second watch and it works i just got lured in to this store with a coupon for a free service that ended up costing more than what is usally charged in fact double i could have said forget it and not bought anything but i did thats on me but its a watch battery i didnt think i would need a second opinion thats what happend to me with regard to needing to buy batteries for some watches and thats all i can speak to|0
i built a new home and am approaching the one year mark and several people advised me to get an inspection before the one year warranty expired my sister had just purchased a home so i decided to have my home inspected at the same time ron came to my home and the inspection was basically a total joke and total waste of money when i received the report it was very obvious that all he did was copy and paste a large portion of my sisters inspection report into the report he completed for me he talks about carpeting and a sliding door neither of which are in my home he also only looked at the more obvious things like making sure lights work etc i could have done a more thorough inspection myself i did ask him to verify that a piece of plywood had been installed in the attic for storage since it is not easy for me to go up there he told me it was not there so i contacted my builder to get it done since it was an option i added when i had the home built the builder sent someone out to install the plywood only to discover that it was in the attic already since they were here they just added the other piece and did not charge me it appears ron should get an eye exam since he could not find such a large object at any rate i would rate the inspection a negative 5 if it were possible i would not use nor ever recommend this company to anyone if this is your only option for an inspection save yourself some money and do the inspection yourself it will be 100 percent more accurate i suspect the entire inspection report was just a copy and paste from prior reports that he or someone else completed hopefully there are no major issues with my home because if there are any i am confident ron did not and would not take the time to find them i would also like to mention rons comment on an earlier review that it is not his job to make the seller happy and he seems to indicate that he wants to make the buyer happy however i thought the purpose of an inspection was to find any big problems that could potentially get worse over time and not to make anyone happy it should be an honest look at the property for problems it is obvious the only one that gets happy with these inspections is ron because he has your 33500 for an inspection report that is totally worthless|0
yikes this is one of the worst banks that i ever had to deal with most of the people are suburbanites who have no concept of toronto or torontonians and they are all stuffy wannabes does this sound harsh well i was putting it politely the bankers at this location are what you would expect to find at a circ branch i have chosen to deal with another bank currently this corporation is doing worse for assets and profits than the other four canadian national banks the others are toronto dominion royal bank scotia bank and bank of montreal|0

ive been to this location a few times its really close to my parents house and makes a spectacular mothers day or fathers day present two or three hours of family togetherness in the presence of wine is a great way to spend time with family so much wine anyway i like the pat franchise because they dont sketch anything out on your canvas in advance it feels less like a paint by numbers exercise and more like your e actually painting i guess because you are actually painting so that mystery is solved staff keeps the atmosphere lively and fun and accessible i mean to say if your e no monet you might shy away from a place like this because you dont want to look silly or talentless or drunk just me the staff keeps the painting simple its broken into manageable bites ive seen some real talentless silly drunken idiots turn out some decent looking paintings again me this is a great destination for charity function team building family outing unconventional date love the concept|1
went this evening with a group of friends only positive thing about the place is the wings big meaty and cheap on wing nights top 3 in toronto probably but the negatives outweigh the positives my friend ordered her steak med rare it arrived med well our obviously overwhelmed server dropped a tray of beer 4 feet from our table lucky it was i i near the table but the topper for me is we went to pay by debit and guess what sorry we dont take debit sorry but are you kidding a bar this size in this age doesnt take debit wif they take visa which costs the merchant more than debit and they have one of those i in mafia grey market atms that cost 5 bucks to use uh no thanks it baffles me why some restaurants in toronto dont take debit that along with the other errors prompt me to say sorry not coming back again|0

i lived in a very old apartment so it is acceptable that not everything was up to par the rent was lower than most studios in the champaign urban area and i was given a 9 month lease so i was happy anyways however the service i got from the administration was horrible right from the start to the end of my lease i applied for a lease after seeing a clean apartment it was made clear that i would be living in another studio that would look the same i had to send in my application online they did not answer for three weeks after which i called in and was told that i could drive to champaign a 25 hour drive and sign a lease when i got there i was told that i was not approved yet and that there were about 40 people in front of me i spoke to christy and she sorted it out they took about and hour and a half to approve my application then showed me the studio that was available for me it was horribly dirty like animals lived there but i was told that everything would be cleaned and the carpet would be changed so i signed the lease a few weeks later i went to move in the apartment was in the same exact state i had seen it when i signed the lease the carpet hadnt been changed or washed it was completely stained black and brown i dont want to know what did that the bathroom door was falling apart the stove was extremely grimy and dirty and small items from the previous lessee had been left in the bathroom which was also very dirty i was told that the carpet would be washed immediately and it was washed in a couple hours nothing else had been cleaned although the lease agreement stated that the apartment had to be cleaned before move in when i was moving in i was also told that the stove would be changed to an electric one it took the maintenance guy a month to come to my apartment to change the stove but he told me that my gas stove worked fine and would only be changed when it broke although i was told it would just be changed no matter what throughout my lease i had a few problems some were fixed and some werent my ac gave a musty sour smell and was never fixed although i reported it 3 times i gave up afterwards normally i wouldnt mind any of this id probably give a 3 star review and that is thanks to christy she was nice and tried to get things done her staff kept quitting i do not know why and she tried to make do with what she had however after i moved out i gave them the address that my security deposit needed to be sent to i never got word from them after that i called over 10 times and was met with a full voicemail box i emailed three times and did not get a response i recently called neves again they finally picked up and was told that they no longer manage the building i lived in i was given the number of the new owners of the building i am currently in the process of trying to get my security deposit returned by a company that does not even know i lived in that building because neves people just disappeared it has been two and a half months since i moved out security deposits are due back by 45 days at the latest according to illinois law it would have been very easy for neves to send a mass email out to all tenants saying the building had been sold and giving the contact information for the new owners instead i had to call them over 10 times this is just unprofessional i honestly believe my 10 year old sister can manage a building better than these people can|0

sunday january 27 2013 hotel review toronto don valley hotel and suites having had a horrible stay at the madison and a disappointed boy on my hands swimming is one of his great loves we got an offer to stay at the toronto don valley hotel and suites it was an offer to good to pass up so we decided to go andrew who was on staff at night was amazing to deal with after thoroughly confirming and reconfirming my stay he let me know early check in was fine when we pulled up to the hotel it was beautiful its located in an area of the city that sits on ravine land a big winding driveway led up to a beautifully enclosed entryway where once we exited the truck we could hear music playing my son said mom this is a fancy hotel they play music outside we did have a few hiccups checking in with our breakfast vouchers from the girl at the desk who we were not overly fond of she explained that the breakfast vouchers were not an option after andrew had clearly stated it was part of our packages he kept trying to get us to upgrade our room explaining that the new rooms were recently renovated and a totally different color like i care what color the room is for my sleeping hours our room was an executive king room and was exactly as pictured i will say that on their site they rave about the views however my view was of the highway and parking lot this may be off putting to some but my son adores watching the highway at night so this was fine for us the room was freezing but warmed up re all lly fast with an old fashioned window unit that was a bit complicated to figure out but worked really well our room was spotless baseboards and all even the old school to is our room was wiped clean and dust free im not one to care if the to is flat screen our room did not have a fridge or microwave and if i wanted one they were 2025 each thankfully my son is not a baby anymore and we didnt really need it the bathroom was big and so clean i liked the old style red granite counter tops and a huge gigantic bonus was heated tile floors ahah high high what a treat in the morning our internet was free which in toronto is saying a lot as may hotels charge 825 a day for internet and it was high speed wireless we were spending the day at the science center so we left for the day upon our return we had some dinner i can honestly without a doubt say its one of the best hamburgers i have ever had ever it was great my son had a cheese pizza that he finished so it must have been great i also had a whiskey sour which was soooo good the waiter was very pleasant and understanding towards my son the boy has adhd autism and odd so his behavior is sometimes difficult in places new to him the fire place across from our table and tis were a great distraction i was also really surprised about the bill it was far lower than expected and way better than many hotels the teal white and cream decor in the restaurant and throat the hotel is so lovely and clean to top off a great day we went to the pool wow the pool is amazing first of all its a perfect circle and the entire roof is a skylight but better yet its warm the first hotel we have stayed at where the pool is so warm its surprising as it got darker several big ornate coach lamps turned on automatically and as it got darker the ambiance almost became a romantic candlelight pool had it not been for my child and several others that is but it was so beautiful the hot tub was really hot and they even have have a family change room which is so smart upon our return in the morning it was a totally different feeling bright and welcoming the lounge chairs are not the same and i saw no drapes but the rest is the same would i stay here again im already trying to find an excuse too with incredible winter rates starting at 99 or 24 night packages from 8495 a night why not enjoy a stay cation other incredible features the most comfy bed and pillows ever room service from 6pm11pm a little shop open from 9a11p some rooms have balconies a seasonally available outdoor pool its so quiet|1

kevin his team did such a spectacular job on my parents home after 15 years many of the tiles on their home were coming loose and the protective paper underneath was worn severely thin over the course of several days the team worked their tails off removing all the tile expertly replacing the protective paper underneath and re tiling the roof although my parents opted to keep their original tile choice roofing made the roof look so brand new and now all the neighbors are jealous the house built in 1998 is now up to 2013 roofing codes plus their workmanship is guaranteed for 10 years and the product is guaranteed for 50 years the job was completed well within the quoted time and my parents couldnt be happier and theyre not that easy to please thanks kevin crew for a job well done|1

well where to begin the wife and i were looking for someplace different in the east gilbert area and thought wed give this place a try we went at about 4 am and the place only had a few guests when we arrived got busier while we were there the dining space was decent and it has an ok to situation for sports etc however the menu was lacking the food wasnt great and the service was terribly slow im pretty sure only one server bartender was working but there was a clear manager present who didnt do a thing but speak profane ly to a regular at the end of the bar with all of the competition in the area we will continue to go elsewhere|0
renters beware we are pretty easy going people we are not shocked or troubled by minor issues that pop up when camping this is not a review on the re this is a review on the character or lack thereof of this company first the ladies in the office are fantastic nicole is very responsive and attentive the re we originally booked le pray haul was broken down so they did put us in another re forester when we arrived the re did not have working heat mike told us to give him 15 minutes and he would repair it ok no big deal you will notice the contract requires you to refill the propane tanks when you return the unit be sure to manually check them before you leave mike asked that we call him with any problems before calling roadside service in case it was something he could walk us through roadside service is expensive fair enough a short time later mike had heat blowing so we were off our first night was rough the heat did not work the propane tank was only 14 full the black tank was full the stove did not work the oven did not work the did player did not work the sofa had trash ankle deep behind it the inside and outside refrigerator had sticky drippings and had to be cleaned a remote was missing ok these things happen we called mike and his response was im out getting parts i will call you back he did 6 hours later mike suggested we must have a propane leak which would explain the low propane and the heating stove issue great now we can worry about blowing up the campground and our family this made us double check the fire extinguisher it expired years ago mike gave us the clear to call roadside service we did roadside service hadnt called back several hours later so we headed to walmart to buy an electric space heater and called mike back mikes response was what do you want me to do about it im in concord nice this must be the customer service they so proudly boast roadside service finally came 24 hours later the technician was appalled at the condition of the unit and said no repair had ever been made to the heat thankfully there was no propane leak which confirmed the unit was not inspected or prepared before our departure we had a few incidents when we were almost rear ended we commented on these aggressive mountain drivers only to find out we were driving around with no tail light on one side nice the final insult came when it was time to dump the tanks yes the hoses had several holes in them so as you would guess the black tank was spewing everywhere so gross we emailed re rentals of the carolina when we returned regarding the language in the contract clearly states you are entitled to your daily rate plus taxes in such situations we never received a response we called multiple times no returned calls so after paying 250 per night we spent our entire trip unable to use our re for much outside of sleeping with no heat we missed a entire day waiting for a repair service and the company wont even respond our experience with re share was seamless and top notch experience we highly recommend sticking to re share re rentals of the carolina is will try to tell you the owners may not be properly insured for renters but re share requires rental insurance be in place deal directly with an owner|0

we stayed back in october of last year the staff made us wait a little bit when we first got there but i would say that was the extent of the cons the rooms were very nice and modern i stay in a lot of hie because of work travel and this is one of the nicer ones that i have stayed in since they made us wait to be checked in they upgraded us to a room with 2 queen sizes and a pull out couch my couch pulls out but i dont haha they also had a small buffet set out at night when was nice for us to be able to just grab some pasta and head back up to the room the parking was locked and private which was nice and we enjoyed our stay|1

took them my taxes to discuss having basic canadian and us taxes done they said it would cost about 800 to do both sets of taxes which is far above what anyone else charges then told me they would have someone call me the next day before any work was done nobody called me i called and said i would come back in and pick up my paperwork because we were going to take the taxes elsewhere when i went back in the following monday to get the papers they said my documents had been forwarded to their production office and they had already started work on my taxes despite not having half the documents they needed and despite telling me they werent going to work on them until after they spoke to me now they are telling me i have to pay them anyway for the work they did uh no nope nada dont go here unless your taxes are very very simple and dont trust them to do what they say they will do also be aware that they charge a lot more than most other places|0

i havent actually stayed here just parked my car for a few days as i was flying out of the charlotte airport i only had to wait may be 15 min or so for a driver to come take me to the airport which is good but called to be picked up from the airport almost 40 min ago when i called back after 20 min they told me the shuttles only come on the half hour which still was 15 min ago this is not what i was told when i booked and am quite sure im being blatantly ignored if you dont want to sit around waiting for an excessive amount of time park elsewhere ive parked at a microbes and they were much better|0

stopped by for a second to grab a quick pickup dinner for my family our pita sandwich with steak and hummus was delicious rice and lettuce bowls were ok too unfortunately our lentil soup was way too thick and tasted like burned lentils also their steak had a weird texture it tasted as if it had been boiled not grilled overall we were satisfied with the food quality|1
i order from here regularly for my dealerships saturday lunch today we ordered a catering tray as usual when the food arrived it looked like someone shook the platter or dropped it i called and ask them what our options were they offered to replace it about 45 minutes later the store manager shows up and was horrible she looked at the platter an said tuna falls off the bread often then half the tray had no meat on on the sandwiches she was not going to give me the replacement because three pieces of the tray were eaten she never once apologized or offered another solution she took the old tray and the remade tray back to the store and i was never refunded this place just lost a loyal customer due to terrible customer service and a very rude store manager oh i also tipped her 5 for coming back a second time and replacing it even tho we were left with nothing|0

probably the worst spot in the entire food court been here twice and both times proved to be disappointing this time was so bad it made me make an account and write a yelp review first of all the lady at the front works at an incredibly slow pace be prepared to wait 5 minutes when your e at the front of the line to even put your order in as for my most recent experience people behind me got their orders first even though they were behind me and they ordered the exact same thing i had to wait 50 minutes for my order if this place served decent food then may be i would of been fine but i had to go and could not of eaten it even if i wanted to i asked for a refund 40 minutes in and the person at the front would not give it to me saying itll only take one second while in reality it took another 10 minutes while the people behind me got theirs 20 minutes earlier the person at the front was being rude the entire time i was asking for a refund saying but its almost done in a mocking tone neither an apology nor compensation for their mistake when i did get my food it was unevenly heated and incredibly bland waste of time and money do yourself a favour and dont even think of visiting this terrible place there are plenty of other places you can go to within a 10 second walk away from there|0
i find it strange that the early yelp reviews were so negative about dag u and yet during dinnertime the line up to get in is over 25 person deep trusting my eyes i gave it a try food specializing in rice noodles there is a choice of different soups along with additional items like beef slices lamb shrimp etc i ordered the tomato flavoured crossing the bridge noodles with extra slices of beef all your ingredients are provided separately you then place it in a bowl of boiling tomato flavoured soup the beauty of this place is that you control how cooked and the intensity of your soup flavouring tip dont just throw everything in at the same time that is a rookie mistake raw meat first or later if you like it more red then cold meats then sauce then noodles then preserved veggies lastly you put in any fresh veggies this provides the proper texture your soup noodle will turn out excellent mine was tangy and the noodles were al dente decor fairly clean and comfortable place is still brand new service i was not expecting ritz carlton still i was pleasantly surprised that my servers were polite i asked for a water when i ordered and got it right away overall the line up is justified this is a good place for some unique tasting noodle soup in downtown toronto another solid 4 tip get there before up the line grows exponentially thereafter|1
came here on saturday to try the chi charro gordian and i have to say it was delicious i also ordered a chichen headache and had jamaica water with it my husband had the bird i a and he said it was the best hes had in a while when we first walked in the place was empty because we didnt realize that they close at 6 am the place is a very humble restaurant no fancy decorations in did e or out its in a rougher area of phoenix but i would totally return|1

average at best the cheese and sauce didnt reach anywhere near the edge of the crust and the sauce itself was pretty bland compared to other pizza ive enjoyed in the past lots of menu choices and pretty quick delivery but not ground breaking pizza by any stretch the driver wasnt very friendly and dumped one of our garlic sauces for good measure try somewhere else|0

this is our third visit with do yep remy an i scheduled my mother early in the morning thinking that the reason we always had to wait 3 to 5 hours was because he was backed up just to find out that he schedules 20 people for the same appointment at 845 in the morning i think its very unprofessional to make the elderly sit in chairs and wait for hours to see the doctor for less than 2 minutes if theres one another retina specialist out there i would suggest you give them a try unless you have several hours to sit and waste very disappointed|0

finding the dress is probably one of the most special moments for the bride but mine was the most disappointing i did find the dress but the service was so terrible that it brought me to tears in the beginning they were really nice probably because they wanted the sale but once i made the purchase it went all down hill my dress size is a 2 and sometimes a 4 but they strongly pressured me to buy my dress in an 8 they kept telling me they run small but when i received my dress it was so big that i had to spend more money than i expected for alterations and when i kept asking for a reasonable offer they got frustrated and mistreated me and my bridesmaids they were nice some days but rude other days it was so confusing i do not recommend this place|0
this shell is a dump and i always resent coming here today for example i had to pull up to three pumps to finally even get a screen on the pump with which i could process my credit card this isnt a one time occurrence here either convenience store looks more like a storage area with clutter and boxes everywhere prices in both the store and for fuel are higher than nearby stations unless your e running on fumes go an extra block in any direction and avoid this place|0
all you get living in this place is noise the walls and floors are made out of tissue paper no joke everything you say or do your neighbors can hear and vice versa there is absolutely no privacy here i have to turn my to up pretty loud sometimes to try and drown out the conversations of those living under me or to drown out the sound of their pet dog barking i transferred here from their sister complex waterfor at the park i left waterfor due to these same issues and while the leasing office will gladly listen to you and assure you they will look into the matter nothing ever changes or ever will change the problem is the place is poorly constructed and nothing was used to properly insulate one apartment from the other to assure some type of privacy also the floor from the living room to the kitchen has started creaking and popping with every step you take on it i asked maintenance about it and they said the boards are bowing up under the tile and nothing can be done to fix the issue except to rip up the floor which is never gonna happen and if your neighbor has a barking dog like mine does forget about it you will hear the animal bark as loud as it would if it was in your own apartment with you the outside of the building looks great and the lawn is kept clean and trimmed silver collections spends a lot and i do mean a lot of time planning events for residence to enjoy both on the property and at other sites nearby that is all fine and dandy but when you are paying over a thousand dollars for a one bedroom apartment it would also be nice if you could enjoy it with a little peace and quiet on the side i am looking forward to the day when my lease is up so i can move someplace else this place is way too expensive compared to the small fraction of it that comes even remotely close to feeling like home|0
if your e looking for people who genuinely want to see you regain wellness and who have a lot of skills and training youll find what you need at limitless motion i did the red cord therapy and the followup exercises heather gave me were easy to do and very effective corrine as massages are amazing i originally went to her when i had a repetitive strain injury and she helped me heal through massage therapy sessions|1

met brian by chance when touring an open house he hosted one year before we were ready to sell buy he kept in contact but never pushy we selected brian after review of other realtors and never regretted that decision this guy is on it every detail is taken care of neither of us had previously sold a home before so brian guided us through the process home sold in less than 24 hours and offer was over asking price buying process was just as easy found a home we wanted 2 days before he was due to go on vacation he made the deal happen and got 10000 off the asking price you cant go wrong with brian he knows what hes doing everything he said would happen during the whole selling buying process did and we couldnt be happier highly recommend|1
i love our vet do sarah at barksdale animal hospital so much she spent like 45 minutes with us today to get to the bottom of a very scary episode that happened with our kitty oscar last night turns out his pancreas has healed itself and he may not need insulin anymore he was having a low blood sugar attack she sat on the floor with him for the exam talked to him petted him and then talked over all the possibilities with us she really listened to everything we had to say and then she asked to see the pics i took of him last night when it happened from those she decided to do a blood glucose test and his level was too low to read im so glad its something we can fix by feeding him the piglet and stopping his medicine and im so glad our animals have caregivers who clearly love them as much as we do mark and sarah have been our vets for 8 pets and something like 20 years now we cant imagine taking our fuzzies to anyone else|1

if i could give them a 0 stars i would gordon barry and his salesman came in with awesome personalities great plans and promises they took our initial down payment and started work as soon as the second payment was made work tapered off and they have abandon our job 5 months later we are out about 20000 and have a backyard one third of the way done they wont return phone calls or respond to us in any way|0
these guys were phenomenal from the initial phone call with jeremy who provided me with detailed procedures on how they clean air ducts to the technicians who came out and serviced our home i must say these guys know what they are doing they called me to tell me they are 30 minutes away so i was prepared for them they showed up in the time frame they provided me and the price stayed the same as the one quoted the technicians were very careful and made sure to clean up after themselves which is quite impressive they also gave me a flat price and there were no surprises as most other companies ive used like to embellish the price i am very satisfied with their customer service and their work ethic amazing company thank you guys|1

worst place ever do not go to these crooks payed over 200 for my tint with supposedly life time warranty and went back because the film that they put in my car was poor quality and got damaged went there and they wanted to charge me to fix their mistakes they did not care that i had the receipt the owner got verbally aggressive and locked the doors i told him to fix it or give me my money back he decided to call some of his other friends that work there and started laughing from the inside of the locked doors if you dont want to waste your money dont go to these crooks and thieves if you want to be verbally abused and these people stealing your hard earn money go horrible experience|0

this is the best hawaiian place ive had in town i agree with other reviewers that kale i is not the best and it is on the dry side however there are plenty of choices with more than 35 entrees on the menu to choose one of the more delicious options i myself love the affordability of this place you really do get a lot with your meal any numbered meat meal comes with miso soup macaroni salad white rice and regular salad or steamed veggies i especially love maui chicken special tofu salad and mango and ava coa do salad here all of these are out of this world salmon meat dumplings and noodles are also above average this is by far one of the best lunch spots in town i would not recommend it for dinner unless its a quick affair the place has a fast food type of atmosphere however if you are not looking to dine in style and just want some authentic tasting hawaiian food this restaurant was highly recommended to me by a native hawaiian coworker maui rose is an excellent choice is a variety of hawaiian juices drinks snacks etc are offered for sale here that are more difficult to find elsewhere|1

we purchased a vehicle last monday 828 from alan he assured us that this vehicle was in good condition we test drove the car and throughly looked over the car with no indication of what was going to happen next less then 48 hours after purchasing the vehicle we had the car serviced and the mechanic noticed a code coming up after running a diagnostic test he stated we would need a new transmission transmission light had obviously been manipulated we went for a second opinion they said the same thing 2800 new transmission well we have a warranty so surely that would cover it but no it was determined that it was a preexisting issue they would not repair less then two days after purchase after many attempt to have my alan correct the issue he pretty much said its our issue we advise him we would be discussing this with our lawyer in which we did and will be pursuing we simply wanted him to make sure the warranty is honored to repair the vehicle or give us our money back neither he is willing to or wants to do we didnt wont to go the route to with a lawyer media or social media involvement but we have no choice we dont have money to be wasted alan seemed like a nice christian man until we attempted to have him resolve this issue dont get duped|0
this course has really gone down hill i played in a tournament yesterday just a 2 man scramble and they overbooked the tournament so much that they had tee boxes with 3 groups on them overall the course was in very poor shape too which i have noticed a decline over the years its shocking to me that any course in april could be as patchy with massive areas of just mud and dirt and big areas of standing water save your time and go play elsewhere|0

this place is a joke we bought a 2013 ford edge sport with 22000 ams on it in october 2016 first red flag should have been when we picked it up the gas was on empty and they didnt even have it cleaned are you kidding me this is how a so called reputable dealership delivers its cars to customers our sales rep gabriel kept calling my husband bro which was quite bizarre its unprofessional and downright insulting to speak to customers that way he used that reference over 50 times bizarre so fast forward to may 2017 we go in for a routine oil change only to find out that two of the shocks are out and its leaking oil are you serious this vehicle was not properly tested for safety before leaving the dealership unacceptable i drive my three children to and from school in that vehicle and it was leaking oil the whole time buyers beware before purchasing a vehicle have your mechanic check it out the best part of the experience was when the service manager dominic almost said he replaced the two shocks before putting it on the lot yeah right any problem that causes leaking is due to a problem that has been there for a while they should not talk to customers as if their idiots or may be he thought because i was a woman he could say whatever he wanted i bought a toyota corolla 15 years ago with 70000 ams and have yet to fix something on it so my husband was given a price on a friday to have it fixed come the following tuesday there was a 100 added to the cost service manager said he would help in bringing down the cost and labour cost but did not not only that he never even came out of his office when he saw that i had gotten the paperwork or even say goodbye as i was paying he just walked right by me like he didnt even know who i was the cherry on top was when he sent a thank you for servicing with us generic letter the next day disgusting never will i buy a vehicle from this dealership again nor recommend them to anyone|0

brides to be and buyers beware the most horrible experience ever for such a special occasion this is not the place you want to go for your dress or for anything for that matter they dont care about you as a customer and are complete liars i would give it 0 stars if possible i went in in september of 2016 to look for a dress i found one i liked and decided to put through the order the display dress had missing beads and a make up stains so i refused the discount for the display piece the ladies told me it would be there in 3 months and would call me as soon as it comes in it was april 2017 and i didnt receive a call so i called they said its in and i can come try it on great so i went then to notice that the dress that they apparently took 6 months to order was in fact the display dress with the same price tag same prices crossed off same make up stain same beads missing so i asked christine is this the display dress she denied that it wasnt the display dress and that they had ordered me a new one that was a complete lie because i know the dress i chose and remembered the flaws common its my wedding dress i think i would know and note every detail so to avoid a repeat i ordered the same dress in pure white and paid in full giving them a chance to redeem themselves horrible mistake on my part trying to give companies a second chance this was now may 2017 and they had promised that it would come in by july with i waited july with came around and no call by this time i have had it i called today july just and the dress is not in and they denied that i paid in full i have the receipt so not worried and that they will not give me a refund and then hung up on me how can a bride to be be treated this way and to have more stress 1 month leading up to the wedding is not needed i had to call back and then christina told me i was being unreasonable and continues to deny that they were trying to sell me a display dress and that they never promised the july with date and it will come in on august with 27 days before my wedding on september ith then accused me of wanting the refund because i bought another dress elsewhere at that point i was livid i went in one full year ahead and this is the experience i received stay away from this store the people are not customer oriented and will lie to you about when they sell you zero integrity i hope no one has to go through what i went through to top that i went in today to get a refund and christina slammed the counter at me and refused to give me the refund they finally did and made this experience the worst ever experience|0
incredibly rude staff google says they do grooming so i called to see what their rates are was told they dont do grooming so i asked since they are in the pet care industry and all if they had any neighborhood recommendations i was told that the yellow pages and google are great places to start i use the vet next door and have considered boarding my dogs here but after this conversation and customer service i will take my business elsewhere to avoid the same treatment in the future and i will be sure to let others know as well|0

i would steer clear of this office i went to this chirp it seems to be the same do working the couple times ive been he either had a bad experience that has caused him to be afraid to adjust you or he is really inexperienced although he wasnt able to get an adjustment out of my low back in past but was able to stretch me out so that i was out of pain i was desperate this past tue 922 because i woke up from sleeping wrong my i 67 were out which has happened to me a few times in my past as long as i go in right way to get it adjusted i am fine since this office is closest to my work on thunderbird out of desperation i went back to this location in hopes that this chiropractor that seems to be the same one every day could help me wrong he not only couldnt help me but he irritated my neck even worse than it was when i told him he didnt get it out he said i was overly tight that i should take some pain pills ice it just try to not think about it forget about it when he adjust your neck you can tell he is inexperienced because he doesnt follow through on the motion of the adjustment get the spine back into alignment i can say this because i just moved out here from california 2014 left a chiropractors office that i had worked for for years doing physical therapy message so i know what i am talking about when i wrote an extensive complaint about this chiropractor to the corporate office in scottsdale through their main website i never heard anything back they dont care its just a meat market take your money move on i have been going to the joint in another location since i moved out here other than 1 other time have always had a great experience but after this past experience having to live in pain since because i used up the last of my budget for the week in order to get relief on this visit that has caused me nothing but sleepless nights continual pain i work in the medical field so it is imperative that i am alert feeling at my best and i dont know about all of you who go to chiropractors other holistic care specialist but i use holistic medicine to avoid putting unnecessary toxins in my body that do nothing but mask the real issue so for this chiropractor to dismiss my issue or the corporate office not to give me a free adjustment at one of their other locations in order to get me the help i paid for then tell me to take pain pills forget about it is unacceptable|0

the service here was garbage in my case it was nil for nearly 30 minutes as i browsed for dress furnishings as the sales team cleaned tables around me without saying a word in my general direction nor to any other shoppers in my general vicinity it wasnt until i came to the cash desk with an armful of pocket squares socks and ties that some guy scooped me up and im sure happily took the commission the selection of merchandise is fine for most demographics though harry is traditionally a more conservative bunch than their holds counterparts the outlet is no exception to that rule just that there appear to be a lot more gaudy units in stock i happen to like gaudy dress furnishings so we paired well in that regard heartland is a crap mall to begin with and i dont think harry outlet brings much of anything to draw me back here|0

i was there last sunday mothers day we arrived a 445 and the place was fairly empty good food good atmosphere lousy service it took a while to get our menus we ordered our drinks and appetizers it was a while until our drinks arrived the waitress took our dinner order about 10 minutes after the drinks arrived the appetizers finally arrived nachos and calamari the server not our waitress did not bring any plates with the appetizer so we requested them the server never returned i set my watch timer when the appetizers arrived to see how long it would take for the entre i to arrive the answer 40 minutes i dont know if it was a waitress problem or a kitchen problem either way the lousy service certainly put a damper on the outing|0
i wonder if we are all rating the same restaurant not very often do you see such a huge difference in reviews anyhow im really hung over after killing two bottles of vodka with a bunch of drag queens last night so im going to get this review done quickly pros outdoor seating the fried calamari oddly they deliver cons forgetful staff as in entire portions of our meal the same sides for every entree gross string beans and potatoes or something noise level cafeteria like atmosphere the gelato sucked a fat one bathroom upstairs like someone else said you get to be the star of the tinkle show every time you need to pee cuz of the stairs being in the middle of the damned room high prices for low quality food i think that about covers it and in case you were wondering no i will not be returning|0
i hardly write reviews but since the positive reviews of scottsdale nails enticed me to go there i thought id leave my opinion i went here for a nail emergency they had good reviews and could get me in pronto which was nice heres the however i went in for a gel french manicure my usual the place was not that nice they may have done some redecorating recently but it reeked of acetone and had a harried sweat shop atmosphere also it took her her pen name was tracy twice as long as it should have over an hour perhaps thats because she spent so much time sawing the heck out of my nails hello thats why i get the gels so i can keep my nails in addition tracy put the white shellac on so thick you could see a bump from my nails profile this thick coat also caused the tips to start to peel off after only a week my gel manicures usually last nearly three weeks what a bust i will stick to my tried and true salon even if i have to cancel and wait to reschedule|0
had a wonderful dinner here last night my friend had the burger with goat cheese added on and i enjoyed the chev aps sandwich with garlic fries on the side both meals were great especially with the house sauce but the service was what really made our meal our server ana was very attentive helpful and genuine and we were so impressed by how welcome she made us feel we will definitely be back recommending thanks ana and royal meats|1

this whole foods location has a small pub attached that serves beer along with various pub fare featuring daily specials on fridays the special is 1 oysters beginning at up got there a little after 530pm and the bartender said they didnt have any more and looking around the pub i didnt see any oyster shells anywhere on the tables so who knows when they ran out so i asked the bartender if i could order a pizza instead and they said you have to go to the supermarket prepared foods section and then carry it yourself over to the pub a bit of a hassle but i figured okay im here might as well eat i walk over to order some pizza and the only premade slices they have available were some strange looking pesto chicken concoction i try to order a plain margarita pizza since my kids would never eat that but the person behind the counter told me they wouldnt be able to get to it until after upma 90 minute wait by this time the line to order pub food at the bar was pretty crowded and i didnt want to wait any longer so we ended up going to a fast food place on it 19 dont waste your time going here go to a real pub or pizzeria or any place that knows how to operate a restaurant and not a hipster super market trying to be ultra cool by offering food yuppie beer but then not being able to actually produce it|0
as we were moving in yesterday 111 we noticed water on the kitchen countertop told the the leasing office he came by and said it was a plumbing problem the plumber came out last night and there is a leak inside the wall the wall is buckling and he ended up taking part of the wall out to see where its coming from now we must wait till tomorrow to see what kind of damage we are looking at the apartment they show you is not as nearly nice as the actual apartment you get talking with the leasing agent tomorrow this is unacceptable and who knows there could be mold hopefully we will be able to leave|0

when i pulled up to the drive thru first thing i hear is pinche carro which translates to fing car i said excuse me and he just asked how he could help me but with such an annoyed and unhelpful attitude i started to place my order and he mumbled something at me and i didnt understand him i asked him to repeat himself and he mumbled it the same way so i just kept ordering i asked to have the chicken mixed because it said i could do it on the menu but he said i cant do that sorry i told him it was on the menu and he stayed quiet and asked me which recipes i wanted and so i decided to keep it the same the deal included drinks and he didnt even ask me the drinks or give me a total i waited in line for 2030 mins and it did not move at all i backed out and left never going to a church ever again|0
do not eat here worst service ever from management all the way down to the host just plain bad service now let me tell you about the food the nigiri is overstuffed with rice and can barely make out the taste of the fish read this article below i have never gotten sick from sushi until now when sushi is handled properly in a reputable establishment by a master sushi chef the risk of getting a foodborne illness from eating it is extremely rare according to fda statistics you have a much greater chance of getting sick from eating poultry or beef than from eating raw fish but if you eat a spoiled piece of sushi you wont care about statistics while you cant possibly know if the raw fish was kept adequately refrigerated or whether the server or prepared properly washed his hands before handling your food you can use your powers of observation to discover clues that may help you prevent putting your gastrointestinal health at the mercy of a less than reputable sushi restaurant how|0
horrible experience i have a migraine today asked for deep tissue on shoulders neck and upper back and this therapist hasnt got a clue how to relieve a headache or even give a good massage my worst experience ever and i have had numerous massages over the years i thought the whole experience from the moment i walked in was not good and the therapist was late needless to say i didnt go back to work after this experience which has cost me time and money now just plain horrible|0
got the voucher for laser for toronto location it was for three body parts unlimited visits minimum 6 weeks break for 1 year i just got off the phone call with a woman that said there will be a 50 charge if i wanted to book an appointment because i missed an appointment she said that there was a note saying that i was advised of the charge which i wasnt she also said that i should have read the fine prints before i signed the waiver form when i first signed up i still feel cheated because no one has verbally warned me of the charges the charges were not written in a well recognizable manner and that it was probably written somewhere in fine prints my voucher was supposed to end in september 2015 and i wanted to make arrangement so that the voucher expires in august instead of september or something so that it is fair to the company and i was denied of such offer i also found that the treatment had no effect on my body and i still have strong growth of body hair 1 they do not provide good effective treatment 2 they seem to be making money off of rigging existing clients of this penalty fee that they do not advise clients of in a conspicuous manner 3 customer service was bad i strongly suggest that you do not use their services|0
for a company that has such a high rating with the bob and other rating agencies i was excited about contacting them with my security problems and having them install a new or fixing my existing system first the receptionist was very friendly and helpful then she put me in contact with the owner of the company jeff and he was very knowledgable and understanding about my problem very nice guy jeff passes it off to steve and asked i keep him informed on the situation jeff emailed me steves contact information and steve contacted me about my camera problems he was very knowledgeable about cameras but needed to find out about wireless og internet connect abl idly thru this type of router 4 weeks later never heard back for either steve or jeff so i called and left a message with the receptionist for jeff but never heard back again about 3 weeks latter i called the receptionist and asked for jeff but he was out on a sales call i explained to the receptionist what had happened and she was very understanding and helpful i explained that i just wanted to know if the company was interested in bidding on the product or not either way i just wanted to know one week later and still no response from either jeff steve or anyone in the company its to bad they really sounded like a great company just thought other may like to know that high rated companies sometimes dont act like high rated companies|0

awful customer service no quality control they sell defective fire hazards we bought a scratch dent oven from this awful place sparks were shooting out of the control board and the oven was working only half of the time after several attempts for their repair department to try to fix it we agreed to return it for another model as if not having a working oven for 3 weeks was annoying enough their customer service representative was so incredibly rude and patronizing it made the experience even worse we took the new oven home and a week later the stove top stopped working upon pulling the stove out to take a look we found electrical ar king behind the stove in the main power connection after unplugging it and taking a look inside we noticed the nuts that were securing the wires to the terminal block were gone and the one hot wire was ar king against the out wire with all of the insulation melted off of it and the terminal block was burnt and fell apart it was obviously taken apart and not put together properly this could have set my house on fire after informing the owner of this mess of an experience he told us it is because we took the stove home by ourselves in our own truck because we didnt have a working oven and needed it right away they couldnt deliver for a week or so and the connections came loose because of it there were no connections in the first place we ended up fixing it ourselves my husband is a journeyman electrician so we didnt have to deal with those people again do not buy from this place your e better off going to leon i or anywhere else|0

what a great day on the river guides mike and becca took our group of 5 on a beginners lesson trip our group had 2 adults and 3 kids 10 14 and 16 we all had fun learning to paddle board and using the rope swing over the river the location was wonderful as the tough was not too deep here the kids could jump on and off the boards easily the slower current and minimal boat traffic made it a perfect spot for beginners mike and becca are excellent guides helping us all gain confidence while having fun after the tour we enjoyed the drinks and snacks we brought with us in the picnic area near the dock the kids loved relaxing in the hammocks after paddling up and back on the river everybody agreed it was a great day and the kids cant wait to try it again|1

i stopped in here for a cookie based on a recommendation that they were the best in town upon walking in there were a few customers but the staff behind the cases greeted me immediately and asked what id like i said i hadnt been in before and asked a few questions about the cookies before settling on a dalmatian which was a soft chocolate chip cookie with white chocolate chips and topped with a layer of buttercream frosting although there were many other delicious looking options perhaps twenty plus my boyfriend asked for a dalmatian as well our total was 190 95 a piece we grabbed a few napkins and sat at the table in the window the cookies were great very soft and moist the buttercream was outstanding great cookies plus friendly service and reasonable prices is a winner in my book i would totally have ordered more except my willpower was strong i will definitely stop back by here and my only complaint is that i live so far away although may be thats good for my waistline|1

i was here for a consultation i was hoping to get some insight and design ideas on what i already have in mind i sat with the receptionist not the artist who has no idea and no creativity over the subject and all i heard is how it cant be done the way and the size i wanted dont get me wrong i did not ask for a super complicated design on a an extremely small area i asked for a simplified version of my reference picture to fit certain size and i wanted the artist to put some creativity into the work but i guess receptionist was not really cut for this kind of conversation if you do not have certain design in hand and not ready for the size they are going to impose do not come here|0
i had a wonderful time tasting some great beers there were lots i have never even heard of including an icelandic beer that was great i think my favorite was the stevens point casper a white stout didnt even know that was something that existed but its amazing and tasted like a lighter porter with white chocolate instead of dark loved it as for the setup it was a bit cramped like roman mentioned i wasnt a huge fan of can jam being in the middle of the rows there were many many almost collisions however the smaller space made it feel more intimate than beer and cheese which i liked summary id go again especially with my stellar yelp crew|1
pass on this place after i ordered a cheese crisp to go they cut up the crisp and jammed it into a to go box and turned it into a small block of cheese with soggy crust not the idea of a cheese crisp when i returned the next day to tell them about the outcome the guy with the beard smiled and said oh we dont have the right to go boxes and let it go from there so if you like your meal stuffed into a box pass on this place|0

i attended one of their goat yoga classes with my fiance the class was challenging and fun and the friendly baby goats roaming freely among the attendees definitely made it more exciting giving 4 stars instead of 5 because of their problematic parking situation which we were told is temporary we had to park on a side street due to a lack of a parking lot and walk 10 minutes alongside a 35 mah country road with no shoulder thankfully the cars were giving us a wide berth and no one got hit other than that it was great and i would definitely recommend this place|1
let me preface this review by saying i am not a big fan of facials because i usually end up leaving with worse skin than i went in with partly due to my temperamental sensitive skin but i think i may have found a miracle at north phoenix massage envy her name is kristi a at massage envy they use murad products which i had heard good things about from a friend so in a last ditch effort i decided to give a massage envy facial a whirl i went in about 2 weeks ago with inflamed broken out skin i left with skin that was much more calm with less inflammation and skin that ultimately cleared up i am still shocked about the last one kristi really knows her way around the murad product line the facial i received helped my face so much and the products she recommended that i took home have helped me maintain my glowing complexion i am still in a state of shock that i finally found a facial list product line that has cleared up my skin i have already gone back tonight for another facial in hopes to maintain my clearing healthier skin kristi a is amazing and if you have skin issues you need to see her and if you just want a relaxing facial from a sweet professional aesthetical she is also your gal|1
passed by this food cart one day and had to stop by to try it out it was located on west dayton street by geology museum the owner was nice and allowed me to make a combo of the chicken curry and i of tea beef meatballs typically you only order 1 of each that comes with rice she was out of the nolan i pata to or leek filled turnovers which i really wanted to try between the two entree items i liked the chicken a lot more than the i of tea it was more flavorful and the flavor was stronger the i of ta tasted good but not as powerful of a flavor i assume afghan food is not spicy but i sure wish it were id stop by again if it were in a more convenient location|1

i recently bought a 2016 ultima there was a single flaw in the tint job i called the dealership and soon after i received a call from the general manager kenny he was super nice and accommodating he sent a really nice and detail oriented man tim to do the repair at my home tim saw some flaws in the tint job and ended up replacing about 75 of the cars tint he closed by giving me his card and asking me to call him if there are any future problems i didnt know until i later looked at time business card but he is an operations manager to think that the general manager sent his operations manager to do my car amazes me and speaks volumes about the companys values kindness quality of work and integrity come to mind tim explained that when his companys techs do tint at the dealerships they dont have the benefit of a controlled environment like when tim reworked my tint in my garage tim continued to explain that the dust of doing tint in arizona makes it somewhat challenging without protection from wind and dust i give one armor a 10|1

there is nothing remotely resembling a crepe from france at paris crepes in mon trial in the mood for a crepe i stopped in and asked for the most basic crepe butter and sugar this was 5 five dollars for basically 4 tablespoons of milk flour and egg oh best part if you want to eat it there and sit down its six dollars for one crepe i asked the delightfully dim girl behind the register if the 5 crepe was particularly good soaked in brandy or had some other reason it was so pricey blank stare no answer silly me i fell for it and shelled it out to satisfy my curiosity and hunger it was pal id undercooked tasteless and very very moist very little butter a light sprinkling of sugar and thats it best of all the chef folded it in thirds and then wrapped it completely in newsprint ensuring the delicate taste of newsprint had permeated into the crepe by the time he handed it to me lo some 15 seconds later it tasted like paper i wanted to spit it out you know in paris they use a small newspaper cone so your hands dont get greasy but because the crepe is cooked slightly crispy with lots of butter and usually has a dash of some liquor it works and soaks up the grease this does not it works the other way and the paper flavor goes into the moist undercooked crepe anyway this has all the makings of a tourist trap owned by some well to do family who bought it from the original owner and has no clue on how to run a restaurant my guess avoid|0
never take your pet here i just returned from an 7 day vacation and was happily going to pick up my two dogs whiskey brindle and gin white i spot after i paid but before i got to see my dogs the cashier who is covered in tattoos wearing spaghetti strap shirt with keys hanging out of her boobs mentions that theres a small scratch on my dogs face who she calls whiskey she says that my dogs were quit being goobers and rough housing the other day quit my dogs have lived together for 6 years they do not hurt each other when they rough house it was gin who had the scratch and it appears to look like the skin under her eye was caught on the fence and drug down because it happened more than 24 hours ago she can not have stitches or have it glued back together so now my beautiful dogs is going to have a skin flap scar on her face very upset also i did not pick my dog up until 11 am this morning and both of them went potty and poo i like they hadnt been let out of their kennel since last night i am highly upset and will never take my dogs back here|0

on june 19 2017 i entered heather hill rehab in hardon ohio after a spinal fusion surgery i had 35 staples in my back on june 22 2017 very late at night i needed help going to the bathroom i had a private room with my own bathroom i was told i needed to have someone near me so i didnt fall i push the call button and asked for help my door opened up and way down at the end of the hall two african american women were there one was very tall and big and her co worker was shorter the taller woman came into my room i had pulled myself up to sit up on the side of my bed and she came toward me cupped me into her arms lifted me up in the air and air dropped me over my bed her coworker said come on ruby we have things to do and so she left i was terrorized because i had 35 staples in my back fresh from back surgery my nurse came in and i told her what happened and she said well your e not her patient and i said whoa if im not her patient why did she come into my room and you dont treat patients like that she never took me to the bathroom than even later i was meeting with the admissions director and told her what happened and all she did was cock her head at an angle and never said a word i said is that it you cock your head and dont say a word one way or another what is going on in this place not my nurse or the admissions director asked how are you lets check your back there was no concern for me at all there was no mention of writing up an incident report which i had no idea you could do that i called my husband and told him what happened and that he had to get me out of that place immediately so by luck the next morning by noon i was out of that horrid place please dont go there it was so horrible|0

i realized today that i have to stop going here which makes me really sad because it should be a wonderful destination the idea is great a permanent drop in centre with loads of great toys but the execution is really off the staff are completely apathetic and no one is overseeing it in such a way that maintains any level of quality getting inside is awful in winter you leave your stroller on a giant sheet of ice outside and then you have to carry your baby and diaper bag through a heavy door whose disabled access button has been broken for months into a dirty coat area try to remove your and your babys coats while your baby sits in the slushy grime then trudge back outside again with one of the locks whose keys are always missing to lock your stroller to the paucity of bike stands back inside the upstairs is sunny and full of toys but gets busy very quickly youll struggle to locate the staff members who are often just hanging out and not helping like they do in other drop in centres its really sad because as i said i think this place could be great if there was a little attention paid to detail like why do none of the outlets have covers on them im surprised there is no one who looks around and sees anything from a parents or babys perspective|0

i booked a haircut for my boyfriend at 515 am when we arrived we were told there would be 1015 minutes wait to which we happily agreed to 45 minutes later the stylist who was supposed to cut my boyfriends hair was still chatting away with her previous client with no sign of process as we had a 630 appointment elsewhere we had to leave our conclusion if you value your time avoid this salon it is also possible that they do not want to cut the hair of english speakers in which case it would be best if they told us up front that was the case when we made the appointment zero stars|0

wish i didnt have to give this business any stars my vehicle was involved in an accident and the police advised me that this business towed it ok fine i call them up on a sunday a few hours after the accident i was advised that i couldnt get any info until monday at 830am so why is that if you were able to pick up my vehicle why in the world wasnt i able to get any information about it an easy way to get storage fees tacked on i guess anyway i called monday morning and spoke to kelly she advised me that she did not know the condition and would call me back never received the phone call back so i called a few hours later i told her since im assuming my vehicle is in rough shape i needed to know my options her first and only option was this pay 240 for the to i and give them the title or abandon the vehicle whats funny is that she never gave me the obvious option to pick up the vehicle right then i knew something was up so i told her that i would give her a call back at that point i decided to go pick up the vehicle this business is located on the main drag of pitcairn i noticed the lot it has an auto body shop and sales lot attached interesting thats why she asked me she about the title so when i walk into the building three guys plus kelly when i approached the building i could hear them talking once i went in everything got dead quiet no can i help you nothing i told them who i was and that i needed to pick up my car everyone was in shocked i guess the assumption was that i would leave it i gave them my credit card and then they said they dont take credit oh is that so you have a credit card machine you are licensed by the state of pa to complete inspections but all of a sudden you dont take credit are you discriminating against me im not trying to think you are but its just feeling that way or did you want to keep my car that badly so i went to the gas station nearby and pulled the cash and the price all of a sudden rose to 395 but they did waive the storage fees ugh this business is such a racket i hate the idea that they are making money off of people in unfortunate situations|0

ive tried this place twice and although there are a few kinks to work out i hope it will be a regular part of my lunch rotation the first time i ate here was an evening just a few days after they opened i customized a bianco pizza and it was delicious albeit a little light on toppings the only problem was that the oven wasnt working properly and the promise of having your pizza cooked in 150 seconds took more than 15 minutes luckily i wasnt in a hurry although because of the oven issue they did stop accepting orders and were turning people away at the door after i got my order i returned after the lunch rush a week or two later and speed wasnt an issue however the person making my same custom white pizza put entirely too much cheese and garlic on the pie so much that it was incredibly greasy and the crust could not support the weight of the toppings making it rather difficult to eat no only that but there were big clumps of garlic that crunched when biting into a slice yet another problem was that the outer edges of crust were burnt to a nearly ash like consistency so needless to say my second pizza wasnt nearly as good as the first im optimistic that the opening kinks will get worked out soon and am crossing my fingers that my third visit is a charm with just the right amount of toppings on a properly cooked crust in the meantime my opinion is that this place is worth trying you may just want to have a plan i should the line be too long or the oven not working properly as for the price if the quality issues get worked out i think its fairly reasonable it would be nice though if you could add a small drink and walk out for under 10|1
as good as it gets for the area personally i like the subs when passing through|1

within the past month ive gotten notices of free hearing exams from 2 different places i was motivated to go because my hearing isnt very good one of the 2 notices came from hearing life promising a complimentary hearing assessment omaha steaks gift pack i called and made an appointment for yesterday while making the appointment i was told they wanted me to bring someone i said that wasnt possible and they said ok when i got to the appointment yesterday i stood at the counter while a woman behind the counter focused on her computer later learning she was cardiologist dawn moore when she finally acknowledged me i told her i had a 10 am appointment it was about a quarter of she kept repeating that i didnt have an appointment so i showed her what i received in the mail with my handwritten notes about when the appointment would be she continued to go on on about how i didnt have an appointment and talked about steaks which confused me until i remembered the invite included the omaha steak pack i finally said look i dont give a she about steaks but i drove here from the eastside to get a hearing exam so what do we do now rude i know but she was giving me a headache i could tell she didnt want to but she said she would fit me in and i wouldnt get any steaks because i didnt bring anybody i said fine lets do the test after my test she showed me a graph of my results shed made with a sharp y a sheet of paper she said she thought i needed a hearing aid i told her i would be on medicare soon and would get one then she said with a smirk that medicare did not include hearing aids i said medicare advantage did i dont think she likes being corrected i asked for a copy of the test results and she refused i asked about the difference between a hearing aid that amplifies versus the newer digital ones that in a noisy restaurant for example will amplify the conversation while toning the ambient sound down she smirked said theyre all digital now and didnt answer my question i said ok what about the hearing aids that do what i said amplifying conversation while tuning out other noise she said well those are about 6000 with yet another smirk as if she assumed i would not be able to afford it in my entire time there i dont think there was one statement i made that she didnt respond to without trying to contradict or demean me i thanked her for the test and for helping me to decide which cardiologist to go to really hoping she realized it would not be her i smirked part 2 the other free test i got was at my hearing centers on the eastside very nice people very professional they asked relevant questions and provided good information including which medicare plans cover hearing aids so they know their stuff and i was given a computer print out of my test results which show all kinds of things like air conduction is bone conduction and stuff i will google to understand but i trust it i do not trust hearing life at all|0
i work very close by and love not even needing to leave my block to get a great cup of coffee and may be something sweet coffee is solid and has lots of different options cold brew is my favorite word on the street is they may be getting a nitro brew set up snow bing is amazing literally the best ice cream variety i can imagine there are signs up on the walls saying its low calorie if thats true im hooked if your e lactose intolerant the mango is awesome if not the coffee snow is the way to go they seem to be learning stuff still but they only opened officially this week so im not judging interior is nice clean and comfortable usually playing some soothing music at a nice volume everything just seems incredibly well planned out and intentional i cant wait to see what they come up with next|1

normally i dont like to write bad reviews but in this case i feel like i have to in the hopes that management will take notice and make some serious changes this place does not even deserve the one star rating i gave it but its the lowest available the service was horrible the drinks were horrible and the food was horrible first off from the time i sat down it took 10 minutes for a server to come to my table and that is not an exaggeration i timed it i ordered a virgin bloody mary and eggs benedict my favorite breakfast when the drink came it was so salty that it was undrinkable it tasted like sea water with a hint of tomato absolutely disgusting the food wasnt quite that bad but definitely not good the poached eggs were completely solid not a drop of the gooey runny yolk that makes me love them so much the hollandaise sauce was more of a paste than a sauce and the accompanying hash browns were burnt on the outside cold on the inside and had no flavor whatsoever i came in for just a quick breakfast because i had a little bit of time to kill and was horribly disappointed my quick breakfast took over an hour was entirely unsatisfying and highly overpriced for the lack of service and quality i honestly can not think of a single positive thing to say about this restaurant|0
this place is adorably quaint the cappuccinos are amazing and the lunch menu is simple and very good the service is quick and friendly everything is homemade and healthy its a kid friendly caf with board games and chalk board if your e looking for cozy friendly healthy and not too this place is for you|1
my husband really likes this place they provide all you need to wash your dog at a reasonable price in addition the wash for the dog is about counter height which makes it easy to wash your dog without the back pain heres for my bad part of the review the last visit the employees were offering dog wash cards to the customers however it wasnt offered to us sadly we couldnt help but think about some type of prejudice against us did my husband look like a thug that day because he was wearing a beanie in the cold weather or are they prejudice against the breed of our dog an american bully whatever the reason we were paying customers and didnt feel like we were treated fairly by simply not being offered a dog wash card|0
this has been the worst experience ever working with alexander funeral home my brother passed away more than 2 months ago and due to incompetence and slowness at their office it took me 7 weeks to get his death certificate and when i got it they had submitted incorrect information i dealt with two funeral homes thru this process alexander was responsible for the minimal embalming transport to another state for burial and death certificate i came to them within 2 days of his passing and paid them in full on that same day first this part may be sensitive to those who have recently lost a loved one they transported him in a container too small so his head was pressed against the top and his head was flattened somewhat when he was laid in his casket for final viewing second it took them 7 weeks to get a death certificate seven weeks i couldnt do anything with my brothers insurance and had to pay everything out of pocket while i received nothing but excuses and blame passing to the doctors office the courier whomever from alexander third when i got the copies of the death certificate that i paid 65 for the information on them had been wrongly submitted by alexander my address as his next of kin was wrong as well as my brothers place of birth fourth for court documentation i need a copy of the bill that says the balance was paid which it was 2 months ago when i started this process why didnt the bill they gave me say paid i called this morning to get an updated final copy with the words paid on it and i spoke with a woman named is barrier she was rude and un accommodating she insisted that the one person who could edit my bill was gone and refused to give me a time frame on when i could expect to hear back after explaining to her all i had dealt with from her place of business she still refused to at least tell me when i could come pick up a piece of paper that should have been given to me at the time of service the bill that i signed doesnt have the word paid on it unfortunately my mind was in another place at the time to be so meticulous i had a colorful receipt but nothing with the words paid in full or any acceptable variation alexander has been unprofessional un courteous un accommodating unaccountable and an overall horrible experience|0
i ordered the traditional poutine it wasnt bad but i wouldnt get it again the gravy was very thin and watery and tasted more like sweet and sour sauce than gravy there was a generous amount of cheese curds and the fries were good but the poutine wasnt very hot either the service was very good and the restaurant looked clean|0
i went there for smog george and his crew were really helpful and friendly and gave me coupon for oil change for sure ill be back thanks again for your service|1
the only reason im giving this a 1 star is because you cant give it a zero so very very disappointed i used to frequent this club back in 20042005 and i loved it the girls were pretty and it was very couple friendly i hadnt been there since 2005it is not anywhere near the same club it once was most of the girls looked like they could have previously been guys they were flat chested lacked personality as in zero personality and frankly a couple of them smelled pretty ripe i was there with my boyfriend expecting to have a great night which needless to say did not happen when we got there we each ordered a shot of patron a shot it was not there was may be a fourth of a shot in each glass and were 10 a piece its a one drink minimum thankfully we drank before we got there or we would have spent 200 for a nice buzz with how their bartenders serve i believe most if not all the girls are lesbians truly i got all of the attention the entire night and the girls were all over me and would not even look at my boyfriend or make eye contact with him i paid for a couples lap dance and it was only me that got the dance even though i asked several times for her to dance for my boyfriend also i kept paying girls to dance for him and they just completely ignored him as well as my requests wishes this happened with every single girl we encountered my boyfriend was well dressed always smells great is a perfect gentleman and is very attractive if i do say so myself as well as many other women lol these girls would not give him the time of day but wouldnt leave me alone even following me into the smoking cube in fact they were extremely rude to him for no reason whatsoever id also like to note that he was not the only male i saw treated that way other men who were there with their women were ignored as well i was under the impression that clubs like this catered to the male patrons but these girls were only interested in other girls unless of course you are an unattractive old scary stalker like creeper with three teeth and a lot of money or possibly drugs to share if thats the case they are all over that these girls are nothing but hustlers and from a few things we saw while we were there most likely prostitutes i was hoping this would be a great couples thing for us to do but it turned out to be a very expensive and disappointing night i would highly recommend avoiding this club unless you are the type of guy i described above as far as welcoming couples go somewhere else i will never go back to centerfolds there are so many other clubs to choose from in phoenix that would gladly take your money and fulfill your requests that its not worth your time or money going here unless of course your e a lesbian that likes flat chested women that will scare you when the lights come on|0
my project is falling apart they dont answer the phones i think i have to hire a new contractor|0
i would not recommend this pre school to any parent i can not say all bad things because is brit was amazing and is an awesome and kind teacher however the owner is the rudest and most inconsiderate person i have met in a long time how does an owner of a childcare business even operate with such an unkind soul as soon as i had an encounter with her i pulled my son out of this pre school the same day it was a blessing in disguise as we found mccormick pre school which is fabulous more to come on that below the owner is a mean lady they will not work with you on anything nor understand unfortunate situations they just do not care the lady at the front sandy is the same way she comes across friendly at times but is just as rude and mean as the owner my son is almost three and he went to this school since he was 2 i kept asking them to help potty train and they never did in fact during the last 3 months of his enrollment there at least 80 of the time i would pick him up in a soaked diaper one occasion i picked him up put him in my car seat looked and felt him and he was soaked in his pants and it went all over my car i spoke to the staff and his teacher numerous times about this siu wait on and it never ceased he never napped there because he was never comfortable there i figure as soon as i changed pre schools he is a happy boy is never wet and naps great at mccormick pre school he was also sick many times i understand that occurs especially in pre school environments but it goes to show the cleanliness which you can see when you are there he got hands mouth foot disease while there his lips were always so red and chapped which was odd i asked the teacher to put on the special chapstick i got for him and he never did on the weekends when we had him his lips were fine on his last day there i took him to his pediatrician the next day because he had red bumps all over his face he had something called impetigo if you look it up its a staph infection most likely from a preschool nasty dirty place since his new pre school his lips are never chapped and his skin is great they started potty training him immediately and within two weeks he is potty trained i asked for over a year i have no idea why i had him there so long especially with the rude unfriendly staff even the lady with hardly any teeth was always barking at me please do not bring your kids here there are plenty of other options and try mccormick pre school if they have openings one more situation that occurred my daughter had attended this pre school as well before kindergarten started as summer came upon us i asked sandy at the front desk if she could come back to this preschool since school was out they agreed and gave me a form to fill out which had boxes to check of which weeks my daughter would attend i filled out the form and checked the box for the week of may hard i asked if she could start may with wednesday and they agreed on tuesday may with at 445pm sandy called me and told me that jade could not attend unless she was doing the entire summer this was the first time they informed me of this new decision i argued with sandy and spoke to the owner marcy she was so rude condescending and mean and stated we dont do drop in day care this place sucks recap rude mean unfriendly staff especially the owner very dirty and your kids will get some odd staph infection they do not change diapers often enough your kid will probably not be able to sleep there since its not even a cozy and loving environment|0
i missed them at the 2017 vegan pox festival but lucked up when they showed up for zen nights they had peanut butter cake encased in chocolate cake pops cookies and a variety of cupcakes i tried a coconut lime cupcake and a choc chip cookie dough cupcake both cakes were moist and the frostings were magnificent prices were good too i got 2 cupcakes for 5 otherwise 3 each to oh my only issue was she wanted to sell me cupcakes that were sitting out she said that she had just put them out but she and the lady that was in front of me were talking over and reaching over them then when i reached the front of the line she and i were talking over them i asked for cupcakes from the covered box behind her it appeared she had a slight problem with this but may be i misread in the end i got my cupcakes from the covered box and my ocd was happy|1
used to work here until i was asked by an employee who was less senior to me in time worked to do something that was illegal operate forklift without ticket they fired me for not getting along with other people in the shop after i reported the incident which i am by law obligated to refuse to do to the he manager meanwhile this jackass is driving the comb lift around with no seat belt lifts a load thats too heavy slams on the breaks tilts the whole load thousands of pounds of wood 16x14x30 raw beams forward and off the forks picking the rear wheel of the comb lift off the ground about a foot before smashing it back down on the ground in the process he was thrown into the ceiling of the cab splitting his head down to his skull spraying blood everywhere requiring a hospital visit and destroying the rear end of the machine which required immediate servicing also putting jobs on hold i guess the three month probationary period trumps any safety regulations unsure about their business practices with customers but if theyre anything like how they treat their employees id make sure they go bankrupt a second time|0

my father purchased me a fine watch for my birthday and told me mays will size it for free the watch was big on me so i took it in for my free adjustment it was memorial day and no one was in the store and i found the jewelry department where a woman was leaning against the glass idly i asked her if it was true they will adjust the watch free she said it was true she put it on my wrist and told me she would need to remove several links i was delighted to see she was going to make the adjustment right then and there the first try and she had to go back remove another link when she came back the second time the watch was still too big this is when she tells me if she removed another link the watch would be too small so i said if that is the case i will get my dads receipt and return the watch but no she tells me if the links have been removed you can no longer return the watch i begged her to try to remove one more link i was thinking if it was too small it is the same as being too big a useless watch i heard much huffing and puffing from behind the counter as she removed the next link in fact the watch fit perfectly after the last adjustment when i thanked her she snorted|0

my name is john and i have been suffering with crowns disease for over twenty years my gi do was out of options for me since none of the medications were working on me anymore so she referred me to do fusco for my surgical options i mad an appointment to meet with him and after waiting in my opinion a long time to be seen i was unsure as to what to do he had a very forward approach to explaining my procedure my outcome or possible complications until he was able to open me up and see just how bad it was he has a very back east personality but spent as much time as i needed to answer all of my questions so i went to the web to try and find some negative information on him law suits or anything to help me decide on what to do after meeting him a second time he started to grow on me im italian and my family was all from back east so im not unfamiliar with that personality but this was my health i was dealing with i then decided to see what negative information on the hospital which was spring valley hospital i was able to find negative information on aspect of there service i did decide to go ahead with them and had to go pre register at the hospital as i pulled up i seen they had major construction going on and i said oh great all i need is the power to go out or something but to my surprise the hospital was very clean and well organized the staff were very professional and made me feel important part of the process was to have my blood drawn go over my history and procedure the in that was helping me asked if my do was do fusco and i said yes but i didnt know if that was a good thing or not she stopped me right away and assured me that do fusco was one of the best and that i should be happy to have him as my surgeon then explained what to do when i showed up for my surgery this made me feel much better with my decision because she was very sincere in what she was saying on the day of my surgery i was brought back right away and ready for surgery in no time my wife was with and she was able to stay with my up until i was brought back to the operating room first the in then the anesthesiologist and do fusco came in and explained what was going to happen next they answered all my wifes questions and told her how to stay informed until she was able to see me again i was in surgery for several hours and immediately after do fusco came out and briefed my wife on how everything went my crowns was real bad but he said everything went well i was then put in the first available privet room were my wife stayed with me the whole time the entire staff from the cans the runs were always available very professional and helped make me my wife and my family feel comfortable and well informed do po in aiya checked on me each day listened to my concerns and ordered medication and fluids to help in my recovery do fusco his assistants and his students came to see me every day to follow up with my care until i was released sorry this is so long but i didnt want to leave out anything and hope that this may help anyone having to make a decision on whether to use do fusco or spring valley hospital for themselves or a loved one easier you mostly hear the negative but i assure you my experience was nothing but positive and i truly believe do fusco i expertise made my recovery time much shorter then expected as well as the exceptional treatment from the entire staff at spring valley hospital|1

im convinced new media west is the crappiest isp in the entire country yes even crappier than com crap the only reason i was a customer was because they had an exclusive provider agreement with my apartment complex i say had because it looks like this pos company has finally gone out of business let me count the reasons why im glad to be rid of this company 1 frequent service interruptions it seemed that my internet was going offline once or twice every week i was constantly having to reset my router 2 nonexistent customer service once i called on a sunday night to complain about how slow my internet was being because it was new media west they had no live technical support the rude customer service representative told me someone would contact me the next day of course no one actually did 3 failure to communicate a few days ago i received a cryptic email from new media west explaining that my building would no longer be serviced by their company it failed however to mention anything about what would happen to my internet service moving forward so imagine my surprise today when my internet suddenly craps out i called new media west to find out whats going on only to hear a prerecorded message directing me to dish customer support after calling dish i find out that new media west has gone out of business and that all of its customers have been transferred to dish i am also overjoyed to find out that i will be without internet for the next 24 hours thanks new media west|0

i really wished this clinic worked out since its only a block away from me but i was disappointed i woke up with an eye infection and wanted to see the doctor asap my fianc reminded me of the walk in clinic across the starbucks that was open at am i walk over for am and it was closed even though signage outside said am after googling the clinic it looks like the hours changed to am sigh good thing this place was down the street i come back for am and theres already people waiting i check in with the receptionist and she tells me there might not be walk ins today what she informs me that the walk in doctor wont be coming in today at a walk in clinic with the only doctor available could only see his patients and wouldnt see any walk ins after asking that this was indeed a walk in clinic the receptionist apologized and recommended going to apple tree on esplanade because they only do walk ins it just blows my mind that there wasnt any offer of accommodation for walk in patients they simply just turn people away after advertising that they are a walk in clinic needless to say ill probably never come back here or recommend this clinic to anyone else i went to patient networks on richmond and yonge and was in and out in less than 10 minutes the wait for my prescription took longer than my entire time at patient networks go there instead|0

i went here for dinner with a friend and it was packed we ordered the two specials number 3 and 5 i believe first is the pork bone soup seafood rice cake the rice cake was decent and the portion was enough for one person but the pork bone soup was definitely lacking in flavour it was bland no spice and it wasnt even bubbling hot when it came out the meat was still sooo stuck to the bone next is the bimbo mba i kale i the kale i was nicely flavoured but it was quite hard to chew also the bimbo mba i was nice they offer multigrain rice so it was more filling personally they dont give you free refills on cold dishes unlike na kwon the service was slow especially in the kitchen i think there was may be 2 workers and the server was really slow im guessing he was new and still learning i wouldnt choose to come back again but i wouldnt mind|0
the 2016 ith of july fireworks event was an absolute joke 5 little roach coaches a couple unsanitary icee stands a man half dead from the heat in a cheap dino costume and some scraggly little booths thats all that was there along with a horrible band playing off key and speaking of unsanitary upon arrival someone had to check our ice chest for beer and touched all of our ice how disgusting i could have had the flu and then every person after me that he searched would have been infected he was sweaty and scratching his butt and i reported him to the police and it was for nothing i could have stuffed a beer can in my sisters purse which they did not search and gotten away with bringing in anything i wanted then finally after being harassed by light trinket salesmen who had megaphones when the fireworks started late they did not turn off the lights and this along with the dust in the air made for a horrible show i will never come back here again it may have been decent a few years ago but now this show is total rubbish i would never recommend this fireworks show to anyone|0
i had the displeasure of attending a wedding reception at our lady of the cedars and it was a huge disappointment the cook was an obnoxious loud rude jerk who treated people like garbage he yelled at staff in front of the guests called the bride a sexist pro faint y to her face was awful to the bartenders do and cake baker on top of that his food was awful the man felt compelled to coat everything in paprika because he is a lazy horrible cook i do not in any way recomend this facility what a joke|0
friendly bartenders pool tables and good drink specials not a fancy place by any means mostly sporty middle aged crowd that said its laid back and friendly none of the pretension of some bars would love to hear a little better music its usually a little dated|1
i just have to say if there was a brad days closer to home in socal wed be frequent customers the setup is taken right out of the chipotle playbook why not its a great formula we made sure to sample the meats that they had available especially since the guys are sensitive to spices my hu i and oldest son had such a difficult time deciding between the kahlua pig and the chicken they went ahead just got the mix in their burrito i chose the chicken on a salad base asked the counter server for suggestions on toppings she was so friendly and my salad looked amazing tasted just as well my 9 year old stuck to a simple chicken burrito with beans rice like i said the setup is much like a beloved franchise but it had a flare of its own i felt like i was dining among the locals and an added bonus they are part of the scrip program you must register your credit card by dining here you help raise a bit of money for the school of your choice yay for my boys school thanks for the awesome meal i rudd ahs well see you again when we come back to vegas for more of our las vegas adventures please check out my blog help lego mars blogspot com201507whats happens in vegas gets captured in himl|1

this is my favourite breakfast place in all of toronto now i have to admit that in all the times that i have eaten at peoples i have never strayed away from my 2 eggs over easy bacon hash browns well done of course white toast and coffee so if you are looking for a detailed critique of the menu sorry to disappoint you peoples food is a wonderful throwback to the day where the division between the customer and the people working behind the counter was more of a family relationship i can happily say that the proprietors of peoples food kathy and nick are two of the sweetest people you would ever want to meet they welcome you as you walk in and feed you with a smile peoples food is not the sexiest place to eat in toronto but it always feels like home|1
on the surface this coffee depot may seem perfectly fine however as someone who has worked there i have witnessed the owner screws his own employees over chow the owner is a chinese guy with glasses and a black flat baseball cap what he does is he always puts a hiring sign on the door of the coffee shop what he does is he receives cos usually from local teenagers and students in the bois franc area calls them back and says hes gonna hire them for training when he does the training for the new employees he always implies that they have the job and there doing a great job however when the end of the training week comes around he asks for the uniform back always pays in cash never asks for a social security number and says hes gonna call them back usually at the end of the week when in reality he never does i would have thought that he only did this to me and i was the only one however he has done this to several people and to this day still puts the hiring sign on the door when hes trained a lot of people for the job its always the same pattern says you have the job trains you for a week pays you in cash never asks for social security number says hes gonna call you back and never does avoid this guy at all cost|0

hands down the best make up artist ive ever been to lene a is so sweet and a joy to get your make up done with i was overly impressed with how amazing the make up was and how long it lasted through the night i never felt more beautiful not only that but she matched the dark competition tan seamlessly since the make up was for a bikini competition she is so talented and kind that i definitely plan on going to her for all my make up needs and even trying new salon services since i trust her so much i cant wait to see her again|1
food was ok but one of the staff members was very rude my friend ordered the iced coffee and she said it was really good being diabetic and lactose intolerant i order the iced coffee black as from my knowledge ordering it black meant nothing else in it but coffee and ice the coffee still came very sweet we asked for it to be replaced and the girl said when order black it still has sugar you should say no sugar and no milk if you dont want anything we tried to explain that i was diabetic and cant have excessive sugar but she was just belligerent i will never go back to a place where they dont seem to care for their customers|0
so yeah we were walking through montreal really hungry and we knew that this will be just another tourist trap and it was worst service i ever had in cam ada so far the waiter is a horrible person as in other references already stated at the end we were just giving him 5 tip and he was so pissed off and telling us that the tip is normally 15 and he has to pay taxes dude for 15 tip you need to smile at least or come over some time to see if we want something food was okay tho small portions quite expensive 16 dollars tax but decent taste garlic bread was awful bread with a little oil not recommended at all|0
i was excited to check this store out because my boyfriend has always been a baseball is i fan and i was hoping the first visit was just a fluke we were the only ones walking in the store and the guy working couldnt even bother to look up to acknowledge us we walked out with a bad taste in our mouths but we decided to check it out one more time again we were the only ones to walk into the store and again we were completely ignored but this time they were too busy watching to to acknowledge customers it was disappointing and we wont be back|0

gist went to this office they prescribed me glasses then said i didnt need prescription glasses and then didnt want to give me a refund for the glasses i bought i went to this office because they took my insurance the first time i came here they didnt look up my correct insurance plan and was trying to charge me a ridiculous amount when my insurance covered my whole visit including glasses i had to tell the receptionist to double check my plan and she finally found the correct plan the one she was trying to have me pay was my back up plan for when i was to covered under my parent i went through my appointment my insurance covers 100 something for frames and they didnt have any frames that were in that price range so i had to pay out of pocket couple weeks later i received my glasses when i told the worker i felt like the prescription was too strong she advised me to wear the glasses for a week and see if my eyes would adjust i gave it time and i finally contacted them and went in for another appointment i went in and the doctor said i didnt need prescription but she said she was going to order a protective lens for my glasses when i came to a realization that i didnt need prescription glasses i called the office to ask if i could get a refund for the glasses the receptionist said since you signed an agreement that all sales are final you cant get a refund i explained to her that i only signed that agreement at first because at the time the doctor said i needed prescription glasses its a shame that the receptionist is not personable because the doctor is very friendly the receptionist kept saying things like im just telling you what they teach me to say dont be a robot there are ways to handle certain situations and she failed she had no compassion at all i dont even want to go back to pick up my glasses that i cant get refunded for because of the lack of customer service and compassion i received from the receptionist|0
came for brunch on a sunday seems they opened before they were even close to being ready no one enjoyed their food most notably the baby food slop in a bucket that came out cold and borderline gray had a couple of orders of the steak and eggs one steak was mostly fat the second orders eggs were so overdone it was like a cement slab of egg which they could have used to finish building the place because half of the area was still under construction detour around the heavy construction equipment the fried pickles were so salty they burned may be they can iron out the kinks but certainly have injured their rep by forcing an early opening one member of our party had been to jail and claimed the food there was better good luck|0
this place is a waist of time and money my husband twisted his knee and could hardly walk and was in pain the woman who called him into an office after an hour and a half wait said that the facility only had one wheel chair and it was in use my husband had to hobble from the waiting room to the office i went down a hall to see that they did have more than one wheelchair i rolled my husband to the door and took him to the hospital emergency room where he was taken care of within 40 minutes we thought the urge i care would be more convenient wrong|0

food is plain and dry for me very basic rice and jerk chicken im disappointed that they dont add sauce in their rice they need to add more into their plate like salad and a donut bread the place closed down not too long ago|0
food overall is decent and at par with other locations however how can you screw up an order and then make a body language to say its such a cumbersome task to make it right a friend of mine ordered the fresh bowl and wanted only veggies but as the food was being prepared the manager puts in chunks of veggie patties in the bowl my friend noticed and pointed it out to the staff the manager had the nerve to make a hand gestures in front of us like we werent there this is a perfect example of very bad customer fix it or we wont be back april 5 2018 update the parent company has responded back for follow up thank you for your care it is much appreciated and shows you care about the customers i love harvey more than the other one with that yellow sign|0
my boyfriend and i are very english and live downtown so one night we decided to venture out of our comfort zone and find a new spot to eat and may be have a drink on the plateau we were starving and searching for a place we wanted to eat at and opened the door to bar inc the minute we opened the door the bartender guillaume shouted the most welcoming greeting to us as if we were old friends i had to sit down and buy a drink and at least a shot for him they serve nachos there but no real food but even then we didnt mind i just had to show this guy how much i appreciated such a welcome and it wasnt just us anyone that walked through the door got greeted this way amazing we have been back since always when guillaume is working we exchanged numbe so with him so we could even make sure hes there before hand the other servers have helped us a lot too and all are just as great the drink specials are amazing 250 shots of jameson on mondays doubles for 550 on tuesdays are the only ones i remember right now and the ambiance is so cool in there customers staff drinks this place has it all im a bartender as well and i even made sure we had our staff party there love this place highly recommended in fact im going back tonight|1
very good when for saturday buffet and everything was hot and delicious the only reason persist doesn i get 5 stars is because they started burning incense in the restaurant which they didnt need because the smell of the food was good and incense can over power everything even your taste buds|1
my fianc and i ordered the chicken teriyaki combo platter which came with rice glass noodles and a pancake we both thought the food was very well seasoned and well portioned for the price the atmosphere was also very nice its a cozy little restaurant with cute do or the only reason were not giving a 5 star rating is the speed of service and what we felt was a lack of attentiveness from the waitress to us but it may have been because there were 3 other tables with big groups there anyway we still really like the food so well be returning|1

here i am in line been standing here for 10 minutes already and i still havent reached their maze of ropes i dont bank here fortunately but am forced in once a month as my landlord has his account here this branch is the closest to my home so its my usual option unless i want to drive out of my way but may be i should regardless of the time or day of the week they keep a max of two tellers helping customers regardless how far out the door the line goes i cant help but wonder if they care about it at all ive watched many other people complain to the manager but none of the other 6 employees in this branch are capable of helping you make a deposit i guess at this rate february i rent will be due by the time i get to the teller|0

i ate here two times my first time and my last time walking in and seeing only three other tables occupied and not being greeted or seated promptly is not really a good start its also annoying to wait nearly 10 minutes for your server to greet you and bring you menus a taco salad does not consist of greasy shredded steak that you i find in a philly cheesesteak mixed salad greens sweet dressing in a greasy taco shell when said taco salad was pointed out as not being a taco salad having a waitress try to tell me i didnt read the menu right and thats how it comes was laughable seeing as though the menu described it as having ground beef pico de gallo sour cream black beans and guacamole the only saving grace was that i only paid 499 for that joke of a taco salad happy hour yes i still ended up paying for it it may be rhodes ranch but even taco bell can make a better taco salad thanks but no thanks|0
my boyfriend and i were looking for an updated apartment hardwood floor aesthetic stainless steel appliances with multiple bedrooms and the property amenities pool dog park relatively close to the city this property fulfilled all of that and was within our budget however the best part of this property is by far the leasing staff mike and terri have taken great care of us since day one there hasnt been anything that weve brought to them that they werent willing to go above and beyond to assist with ive seen a lot of bad reviews regarding car break ins and bad parking may be the security has just gotten better in the last few months since i moved in but i have fortunately never run into my or any of my neighbors cars being broken into i was sincerely shocked to hear that this property had ever been associated with this i have had problems with not receiving ups packages but ever since i asked ups to deliver to the leasing office for me everything has been fine regarding the parking i have definitely witnessed this as a problem however the leasing office started providing new parking passes to all residents and started towing the cars that dont belong and my parking has been fine ever since ive easily been able to get guest parking passes for all of my friends who were staying late or spending the night again very impressed with the property staff for taking care of this issue overall i am satisfied with my decision to live here good apartment good location great leasing staff|1
customer beware saw ad for 777 oil chance with coupon typical bait and switch manager carlos immediately tried the bait and switch even though i was told different on the phone but that is not the big part of it when i asked to many questions as to why tell me one thing on the phone and another when i arrived he said get out when i left as i was walking to my car i was bullied by several employees pushed and threatened i called metro police event llv160518001189 when metro wanted to see sure fence camera tape they would not show saying they were not working the truth they did not want evidence of assault these people are bad business bad customer service with so many auto repair places in las vegas please do not support bad business this was a customer that went from an ad that was threatened as i was leaving carlos and staff can not be trusted|0

i hope someone reads these reviews looks like it is not just me having issues my biggest mistake was taking my mum here i went checked with them which doctor they could recommend i was given the lady doctor went for our appointment at 10 am on thursday ith june was seen at 1045 after i asked them how much longer we had to wait the doctor had no questions for us i took a file with all my mums previous medical records she didnt bother even looking at it just asked us the reason for our visit i informed her that i would like to have a doctor for my mum showed her all the medication she was on my mum is 83 years in pretty good health just the usual age stuff the doctor went on ordering tests she had one for almost every letter of the alphabet she orders a pap i informed her that my mum had a hysterectomy had she asked us questions she would have known that then she says oh then you dont need it she tells my mum that she is doing amazing looking at the tests results i had taken with me practically forced her to look at she encouraged my mum to go to the senior citizens center etc all that was good this morning saturday someone calls me on a restricted number i cant remember his name as i lost him at critical he says he is the ma on call i think that my mum needs to be taken to the er immediately for a blood transfusion i said what whats wrong with her then he says they received a critical blood report asks me has your mother collapsed i started laughing as i thought it was a joke then i asked him from where he was calling he said from east valley family medicine in a what uk ee i said no she hasnt collapsed no she doesnt need a blood transfusion i asked if i could speak to the doctor i saw on thursday then he says i can talk to her only on monday to this i said then i will decide on monday then he says by monday my mum will be dead he said if i dont do the blood transfusion for her today she will die in a couple of days i asked him which count was low he said hemoglobin then he said it is at my own risk that i make the decision since i had no doctor to talk to i have scanned the internet for symptoms none of which my mum has lol and nowhere does it state that a low count of hemoglobin requires blood transfusion or you die it says its due to a low iron count or low folic acid or hemorrhoids i did inform the doctor that my mum does have hemorrhoids on off it is obvious that the person calling me had no access to any of my mums information he was just reading off a script rude hadnt heard of medical etiquette if my mum was so critical going to die in a couple of days according to him then the doctor who saw her should have been calling me not someone who had no clue what he was talking about anyway is that the way to talk to any human the worst is he wants to speak to my mum for what to tell her she is going to die in a couple of days which old lady will ever want to go to the senior citizens center as suggested or even get out of bed when she is told shes going to die in a couple of days she just feels fine i hope they see this review for all the stress i was put through this weekend not knowing what i should do no one to be contacted i will report them to the authorities people like this should be shut down not allowed to have a medical practice i will go there personally on monday please dont ever go there its not worth your time|0

i love mexican food i live across from the fajita grill i have only been there twice in 4 years as many of the other reviewers have said the food is subpar mexican food i appreciated the complementary chips and salsa and the incredibly unhealthy boat dip was pretty decent i had the tofu mexican which was mushy tofu and overcooked vegetables as hit or miss as mad mex can be since it opened i have been there more times than fajita grill it is bob but when i eat mexican i want an ice cold margarita they also charge for sharing plates 250 and ask that you split your check prior to ordering|0

the worst service department ever if i could give this phoenix motors 0 stars or negative stars believe me i would took my car in for an ac switch problem and came away with engine damage my ac was not coming on immediately when i pushed the button so i took it in to have it looked at at the end of the day my service adviser said they found a loose wire that was causing the problem and fixed for 38000 seriously then he proceeded to tell me that after performing a thorough inspection of my car there was a host of other things wrong with it that needed immediate repair there was nothing else wrong with my s600 when i took it in and if i would authorize 10000 worth of repair work they would get to it right away i told him to have my keys ready and id be down to pick it up when i did pick it up the under panel of my dashboard was still unattached and sitting on the front passenger seat there were empty water bottles of the service men littering my back seat very irritated i complained and they sent a man with tools out to the driveway to fix the under panel didnt even bother to pull it back into a bay wish i had looked in my car before i paid when i started my car it didnt sound right it was idling high and went into gear hard mentioned this to robert wolf service adviser and he dismissed it saying it will drive out i left and didnt make 2 miles before my car went into convulsions spud during shuddering and kicking out smoke then it died in the middle of indian school red once it did restart i limped it into a parking lot and called my service adviser robert wolf he feigned ignorance but sent someone to pick me up they then had my car towed back to pic i will say that they gave me a loner car but they proceeded to keep my car for 20 days while they attempted to repair whatever it was that they did and in the end they fixed nothing and took no responsibility of course they told me everything that was wrong with my car was my own fault and that they did everything they could to correct what happened except that when i took my car in only for an ac switch mind you they proceeded to monkey around with my car checking this and that with no authorization from me to do so so they could discover every way possible to milk more and more money from me they claimed to have done all of this work while my car was in and gave me a staggering list of things they said what i needed essentially were valve seal covers and charged me 55500 for them tried to charge me for more but i refused i had to scream and yell to get robert wolf to listen and he said they repaired or replaced everything else that may have caused the issues before no apologies but more empty water bottles in my trunk and a missing gas cap these guys truly suck when i left after picking up my car for the second time this time i made it to the 51 fly when the problems started again i called my credit card company est to do a charge back and aka second had my car taken to another service center these guys are a bunch of crooks i own 3 mercedes benz cars and will never trust the repair of any one of them to phoenix motor company ever again and i caution anyone reading this review of the same i called and sent numerous emails to owner chuck thisen and general manager al lemoine all with no response poor very poor never even received a courtesy call from an assistant to say they were looking into it worst customer service ever i was shocked and appalled at the way they ran their business so i encourage any other pic customer who has had a similar experience to voice their displeasure here and everywhere so others may be forewarned and may be pic will take note of just how truly awful their service department is|0

excellent experience we used do transportation for the first time earlier this month i looked up their reviews and after seeing how positive they were we decided to give them a shot wow were we impressed the driver don i who took us to the airport was right on time pleasant professional and very humorous he helped start our vacation on a very positive note for our return trip from the airport our driver left me a voicemail about 20 minutes before we landed and told us where to meet him he was very courteous when we arrived at the car and got us home in record time do transportation helped us end our vacation on a very good note i plan to use do transportation whenever i need transit to and from the airport i also plan to recommend them to my company as a great option for our transportation needs particularly for our vips you can not beat the service|1
my boyfriend is in love with this store and to be honest with you ive never been much into furniture or home decor not to say i dont appreciate fine quality furniture or a nicely decorated house but my idea of good furniture went as far as ikea there are a lot of pretty e central furniture stores in the queen west area very modern and sharp pieces that are beautifully crafted and best of all you dont have to piece them together at home the plushies i couches the most gorgeous wood tables and chairs you just cant help but admire the craftsmanship pavilion looking at the quaint storefront looks like another overpriced furniture store from the outside but its actually not too bad inside im not saying i would furnish my whole house with this store id probably go broke and have to sell the house but buying a few pieces would make all the difference they have neat mirror pieces 150 and a beautiful wooden beach made from log pieces 500 nice lamps and couches 3000ish worth a visit even if your e just looking staff seem friendly and not pushy like at the brick if anything youll get some great ideas for your own home decorating|1

sorry cant give this place more than 1 after a bad experience used to be sweet dive bar now its just a local load ie bar bartenders dont care no management and the karaoke guy is a real piece of work he assaulted a guy while we were there and acted like he owned the place way to treat customers never will go again unless i am looking for some fisticuffs then i will go for sure|0

i am not a fan of italian food and the fact that this is my favorite restaurant in calgary speaks volumes i have eaten here a dozen times and each time is better than the last the food is outstanding as is the wine menu i would gladly eat here every single night but my waistline would probably not concur i have had almost everything on the menu we order family style and i loved it all it is a fun place to eat the perfect place for family meals or an outing with friends very child friendly as well i wouldnt say it is a place for a quiet date night however it can be loud it is a busy place it is bright open and modern it is upscale but i wouldnt say it is stuffy attire ranges from jeans and shirts to business suits dresses they offer gluten free options and are happy to help if you have any special dietary requirements there are some growing pains as with any new restaurant but each time i go it is better the servers are eager to learn and please and the management is more than willing to listen to any issues and make every attempt to make it better that effort to be better and strive for perfection is worth any possible issue review 2 of yelps 30 day challenge 2012|1
a very nice young guy came out to look at fireplace for a cleaning and he would not touch it he said that the design of the fireplace was dangerous and a fire hazard even though the firebox is solid and the construction is a little different than most houses paid him an inspection fee and he did not want to clean it and have us pay for the cleaning so he came out and made money to tell us that it was unusable he was very nice but obviously didnt have much experience our fireplace is set back and is different because a large mantle was built on in front with a bench and fireplace is set back we paid for a second opinion and a person who was very knowledgeable came out and told us about how everything worked and although it was unique construction it was completely safe and in excellent condition chimney cricket company made us feel that if we used our fireplace the house would burn down thankfully we got a second opinion and have used the fireplace extensively throughout the winter with no issues at all i would not recommend using the young guy at this company make sure you get someone else this company wasted our money and did nothing to help us|0
i love and respect the ownership and closing on sunday for religious reasons good for you guys|1
pretty disappointed this place was actually not bad but recently they have gotten worse and worse i understand that its all you can eat and you are able to order all you want but their portion sizes have gotten ridiculously small quality has decreased too they also increased their price|0
breakfast sandwich is phenomenal as is the chai the service is also very friendly we had to wait longer than expected for our food and the owner apologized personally and they threw in a free cup of fruit looking around service in general seemed very fast so im not reducing any stars here i have not been for evening trivia or any other key features but would highly suggest this place for a solid brunch spot seems like its never too busy in the mornings and there is ample space for even a decent sized group definitely some place i intend to frequent great space for that person looking for a place to do some early morning work in a peaceful environment i think the tucked in neighborhood location has this off of some popular radars which from what ive seen seems like a win|1
we had gutter helmets installed by cramer havent detected any problems so far however our interaction with the company could be better during the installation the workman completely flattened my herb garden he didnt leave one plant standing when the company made a followup call on the quality of service i mentioned this she seemed very disinterested after we paid our bill which we did promptly they kept calling us to request payment this was long after our check had been cleared by the bank apparently they dont keep very good records finally my husband insisted that they go over their records they discovered the check but not a word of apology for harassing us|0
it was recommended to me by a reliable source to make my next purchase at davidson i checked out the store it was very busy so i visited their web site they encourage you to email them for a quicker response by the way they never replied so i gave it another shot needless to say i purchased a fire arm on line and actually used them to do the transfer i was aware of the fact that my fire arm arrived on saturday may ith in the afternoon so i called them they claimed that they dont process transfers until monday then come to find monday is by appointment only so i had to wait until tuesday may i add they seemed so put out and inconvenienced every time i spoke to anyone at the shop i am a fair person and give people the benefit of the doubt however they are not a friendly bunch in that place so i obviously did not have the same experience as the other posts the only friendly person in the place is a hispanic salesman that i have encountered a few times i dont like sites likes this so it angered me enough to set up an account and post this comment i will never do business with these people again|0
yes its a buffet thats not say in much in madison there are some really great chinese places an this a int one of them they do have lots of different dishes to try nothing really stands out good for a quick lunch if you like cheap fried food ready when you walk in the door only thing i wonder about is how long the sushi has been sitting|0

caught steve and the orange true in norton one evening we tried the blue crab balls sour kraut ball and the lobster mac and cheese everything we tried was above par and not what you would expect to find on a typical food true but this is by far not a typical food true the lobster mac would be worth driving across town to wherever they are to get it again for sure cant wait to try more of his menu|1

reviewing on two experiences my husbands and my own when my husband signed up he found the staff to be pushy they told him his membership would later be able to add me which we have found to not be true he said the weight room was amazing but the rest of the facility was in poor condition or basic for myself i couldnt get pricing online on the phone so i was told to come in i go in and found they didnt have their pricing binder updated at the front so they told me to come back another time they also had me fill out what looked to be a liability waiver card for a tour and then told me they couldnt give me a tour they want me to come in again but im starting to think it might be less of a headache to just buy equipment for the home or run outside|0

ok montreal is supposed to be a french town so i had high expectation for our dinner at maison would we had the prix fixe menu on christmas eve there were hits and misses but i can honestly say ive had better french food in chicago than there i liked my foie gras terrine the sweet bread crispy outside and well seasoned and my husbands dessert some blood orange sorbet i didnt like my veal and i really didnt like my husbands steak its weird they both looked well cooked mine was medium and my husbands steak was medium rare but both were really chewy one of the worst meat course ive had next time we are in town wed still stay at the same hotel but probably wont eat at this restaurant again|0
alright let me be honest i never liked pizza hut when i was 16 i worked there and from my dominos review you can catch a glimpse into what that was like for a hot second and i have never ever been back willingly in fact the one and only time i went willingly was when a then friend allowed us to stay after hours and the manager signed off on us getting free beer we all called the place pizza slut i know were so original folks we live in a new era pizza hut has swayed my cold black franchise pizza hating stomach i dont know who got hired and who got fired in their or department but hot damn whoever is in charge now is doing great they should be hired to make north korea look like heaven or cat vomit a delicacy ok thats taking it a little too far but you get my drift it all started with a random stumbleupon the australian contest to make your own pizza name it and enter to win crap not that i can win anything here because i live in the ol us but it was kind of entertaining to come up with combos also they can get duck on their pizza you hear me duck so i did a little internet searching and lo and behold a few months later pizza hut us rolled out a new menu it was missing the duck but thats aside from the point it looked delicious it promised new things sriracha was involved lest you think i order pizza all the time out of laziness and love let it be known that i actually enjoy making my own and the boyfriend usually has to beg me or piss me off to get me to agree to getting delivery i like to cook and most of the pizza places that deliver in my area think charred crust half a mushroom and ketchup tasting sauce constitutes pizza not pizza hut circa 2014 and 15 now i know the new menu is pretty awesome and the combinations are seemingly endless adding extra balsamic or sriracha drizzle i or the long list of crust flavors for free is a great touch the website is easy to navigate i hate calling in delivery orders and gives you a countdown that has never failed to be almost completely on the dot accurate the 11 anything you want size toppings crust etc online deal is awesome for people like me who cant make up their mind and want like 10 toppings my pizzas used to cost a small fortune there is an added charge for the stuffed crust but its a measly wish bucks and i cant blame them so for the second time since i discovered this new menu we ordered some last night our pizza was on time it was tasty they even followed my orders to make the stuffed crust pizza extra crispy the toppings were plentiful the sauce was excellent i always get the creamy garlic parmesan but they have buffalo biq honey sriracha classic marinara and premium crushed tomato told i pizza hut doesnt suck anymore also search the internet for their newest japan commercial that involves a bunch of cats running a store because why not|1
core scores again two weeks ago my husband and food and wine writer glenn called dinner the best ive ever had in leslieville this week he changed it to the best dinner ever east of jarvis the occasion was a wine pairing dinner featuring cloudy bay sauvignon blanc and pinot noir lewis robinson cores chef de cuisines dishes were inventive and flavorful the selections were superb the price was ridiculously low considering that one of the wines is usually priced at around 300 a bottle owner mark offat told us there are definitely more wine dinners to come the east end has its fine dining for foodies spot my prediction is core will soon be as crowded at dinner as lady marmalade is at lunch|1

doug palette did a great job i had called the company for service on my old water softener unfortunately the unit was beyond repair doug was honest and straight forward with his assessment of the situation he was able to install a new unit so we were up and running in a short period of time i like the idea of the new unit being american made and that the company has been in business in las vegas for over 25 years|1
do not shop here i went in here on the evening of the art fest it was very crowded as the space is small and it was a busy evening i saw a felix reproduction clock on the wall and asked to purchase it to my surprise they didnt take it off the wall rather had some in boxes below the register when i got it home i realized it was very poor quality cheap plastic not worth the 5000 i paid for it a few days later i went to return the clock and they informed me that they have a no return policy they said it was posted by the register i explained to the owner that it was extremely busy the evening i purchased it and did not see the return policy nor did anyone inform me of it i asked him to make an exception this time and at least allow me to pick something else out as an exchange or to issue me store credit he refused to do so he was rude and unwilling to compromise buyer beware|0

very delicious durian desert made like lady i style the durian flavour still stay in the cake yum yum|1
im always excited about a new mexican or burrito joint in town i welcome the addition of gob my first impression is that its a clean friendly addition to the madison burrito sweepstakes the service and venue are great the food barely ok i ordered the chicken burrito and it was well assembled with pico and chicken minus the be an and rice fillers that most of us can do without and that i in fact usually omit when going to chipotle or quota or other burrito joints the veggies and salsa were great they seemed fresh and had a nice kick the chicken however tasted heavily salty and didnt appear to be the quality cuts of white meat that i would hope for it reminded me less of chipotle and more of taco bell my suggestion for more stars would be to upgrade the chicken but since gob is a chain this might be difficult to do dont try to hide lower quality meat by salting this might fool the 230 am bar time crowd but not many others while im not ruling out trying them again i will pass on anything containing chicken|0
our board exams are administered in charlotte and the national board struck a deal with several hotels in charlotte but the closer ones were booked on my test date so i decided to give crown plaza a shot first off when i called to book they had a bit of trouble locating the code for the corporate rate i was requesting they also are not able to send a confirmation email until of business hours so i had to call back to get it however booking and checking in went smoothly despite my flight delay and late arrival around am that sort of ends the good stuff i went up to my room and immediately got ready for bed there was a dark black make up stain on the side of the bedsheet no biggie sheets probably were bleached and washed some oil based make up is just hard to get out and at least im not sleeping on it the rest of the bedding looked clean however i could not for the life of me figure out how to turn off the vent i had turned off the heater ac and fan settings but was too tired to fumble with it more i figured the white noise could help me sleep good thing too because as soon as i turned off the lights i could see the 1 am gap between the bottom of the door and the door frames threshold not good for hallway noise however this was not what awoken me 1 hour before my alarm set off you see each room is connected to its neighbor by a thin not soundproofed door and i woke up to a mans coughing and television playing before my alarm went off groggy i got out of bed and started washing up some aspects of the bathroom may be renovated countertop but amenities are a bit lacking first the towels definitely seen better days two of the four large ones had pink and neon orange stains on them likely also make up that hadnt come out with washing but still a bit thinned and worn the towels should have been replaced by now second there was no shower mat in the bathroom im always leary of foot fungus in hotel showers but i didnt want to wait for housekeeping to bring one over finally there was a single bar of soap to be shared between tub and sink and only a conditioning shampoo a bit below standards for a crown that being said water pressure was great but temperature could not get very hot finally when i went downstairs to check out the receptionist didnt even get off the phone to address me when i turned in my key she just printed a receipt and turned her back around i understand if she was dealing with a difficult patron but at least have the courtesy to smile and acknowledge me i waited for her to get off the phone to ask about the shuttle to take to my exam site and she snappy ly told me its not here yet i asked for the restroom while i waited and she hastily pointed down the hallway not what i was expecting for southern hospitality hopefully renovations will address some of the issues and perhaps management will also address the room amenities and service inefficiencies told i hotel lacks in amenities and service but the real downside is the noise for those that need a good nights rest hope for improvements with renovation|0
this place is super slow id go elsewhere if i were you the food is iffy at times too they need to his more for the summer|0
i originally contacted craters freighters for a bob deal my first communications were rough to say the least but dennis contacted me directly and we worked through my concerns he and mike came to base layer manufacturing checked out our product and felt confident they could do the work i received a quote in a timely manner and when we had to hold back product a second revised quote quickly everything was handled professionally and quickly just as one would expect in a bob communication the best part is that their shrink wrap team showed up to do the work and they wowed us with their work ethic and team work we are hoping to build a long term relationship with craters freighters based on our latest interactions with them high fives all around to that shrink wrap team|1
i registered myself to take business english class with leslie viral at hans i started off by taking the one hour class a day but one week later i joined the 4 hour class a day i had such a great and unique experience during these classes in the short period of time that i attended this class i gained a vast array of knowledge that wasnt restricted to business english only the style of the classes were very stimulating and everyday we all were able to discover a little bit about ourselves and others the activities presented by the teacher and the way she would guide us through the process was just perfect to create a stimulating ambiance to learn in some of the lessons were more technical for example business vocabulary and expressions others involved individual presentations which would end up with the teacher evaluating the presentation and pointing out all the good and bad aspects her constructive criticism was very helpful there was also group activities where we learned how to deal with different cultures and points of view to reach the best results now one thing the school really needs to pay attention to is at the registry desk currently its a mess ive experienced and witnessed many times students coming to get help and the employees are forever busy on their computers they see us there but they dont have the courtesy to at least say just hang on for a minute im going to help you its confusing especially for people that come for the first time they dont know if they are at the right place or not it just looks really bad on the school a professional greeting is recommended other than that i have no complaints based on my experience i would give 5 stars but because of the front desk i will give 4|1
i was told it was going to be 50 when the technician showed up he told me it was gonna be an extra hundred dollars because this was a special type of car the technician that came out was a subcontractor called the office and spoke with chris from las vegas locksmith and he was unaware who i spoke with at that company but was told it could be in excess to 180 when i initially asked how much it will be i was told a flat rate of 19 for the service charge and 35 for labor whenever i called i was hung up on next time i called he talk to the technician after i spoke with him and then did not even talk to me afterwards the technician told me that all he said was he was sorry it was a lot of miss information that i received and was given to me in addition to that there was no help that was given to me|0
i had high hopes for this service i purchased a six hour deep clean through an online marketplace site i purchased the service in december and it expired in march i contacted them in january and scheduled an appointment in february i prepared for their arrival but then i got an email the morning that they were supposed to arrive that they would not be coming due to the weather road conditions it was 65 degrees that day no matter where they lived they could have come an hour or two late and driven on dry roads then we rescheduled for march and i again prepared for their arrival they have a contract where they tell you all the things that need to be picked up and straightened in order for them to clean standard stuff lots of prep time this time they just did not show up they also did not return my calls emails texts i hope nobody else has to waste their time energy and money on this business it was stressful for me|0
ive lived in las vegas for 8 years and have moved every year since ive been here this is the first place that didnt offer me a cheaper rate at the end of that year instead they wanted to charge me more money anyways i lived at camden for a year i dont like that they automatically charge you for cable however they charge for water it doesnt make any sense also the front gate is extremely annoying one gate is for people to swipe in and the other has a keypad that no one knows how to use about 12 of the people have a key to open the main gate and everyone else just follows that person through the gate might as well not even have a gate i also had a downstairs neighbor who made my apartment reek of marijuana for a few months until finally he moved out i complained to management but im not sure if that did anything i will say that i liked the giant bathtub thats about it|0
i dont normally write reviews but i had to for this one if you are looking for overpriced low quality mexican food this place is for you chips and salsa are great my main entree was an 11 chipotle honey chicken it was just beans and rice with plain chicken and sauce drizzled over the top for what it was 11 is just way too much considering the low quality taste my wife ordered the nachos supreme which had dry chicken and a mound of wilted lettuce on it the size of a football they should call this one lettuce supreme because all you eat is lettuce im only giving 2 stars because the chips and salsa were good|0
do bowers was absolutely fabulous after my dog got me in the eye with his claw i went to se wick ly emergency first they called him for his opinion and wanted to see me right away very professional wait times reasonable given that the world doesnt revolve around me and other people need seen spoken to as well and he did an excellent job highly recommend|1
i called in advance and made an appointment because i wanted sons nails not all technicians do this i was assured they had sons color and could do my nails i arrived at the salon at my appointment time but could not find parking they have very limited parking in front of the building so you can park on the street pay or park down on a side street and walk up once i finally found a place to park i hurried in since i was about 5 minutes late for my appointment no need to hurry though since i ended up waiting another 40 minutes for the technician to do my nails during my wait i did not get offered a drink they did not start to remove old polish from my nails i was just left to sit on the couch after 30 minutes i did get up to ask if it would be soon got the definite impression that the hostess thought i was out of line for being unhappy with the wait once i finally got my nail technician she was really nice however it took quite a bit of time for her to locate the sons stuff considering i took the time to make the appointment for this process i wish they would have found it before i was there the actual application of sons was fine just fyi if you are getting a pedicure they do not have those massage chairs they have these upholstered straight back chairs that i think are supposed to look fancy but dont look comfortable i prefer the massage chair myself later i found out that the salon right down the street queen city has sons has way more colors knows where they are had more parking available and was even a little less expensive i would just go down the block if i were you|0
we were seated right away and immediately ordered some warm and delicious jasmine tea next we were given the royal treatment warm moist towels to wipe our hands with is this the high life we practically ordered everything on the menu got the paradis veggie tempura 911 kamikaze spicy tuna and spicy salmon all were delicious and fresh also the spicy sauce was amazing the only negative was some of the decor and lack of parking the bamboo on the wall must not be securely attached because it shakes and makes noise when i sat back on the booth chair otherwise great sushi and will come back to order the sushi on a boat|1
tapi no is a great place to go for wine and a little bit of fancy food if you want to gorge yourself the claim jumper is in the same parking lot but if you want to relax and eat something tasty and have a great evening tapi no is a much better choice the atmosphere in the restaurant is great the service is unfailingly helpful and chef porter really makes amazing and interesting food and loves doing so i personally think you can tell when food is prepared by a chef who is passionate about what theyre making and tapi no only proves that the prices are really not that bad may be im ruined on affordability because i live in california but it doesnt seem all that expensive to me your e paying for a lot of things when you order a restaurant not just quantity if you just want quantity see above the normal plates non happy hour run 812 each 23 of those easily make a full meal i had 3 last time one of which was the beet and tomato salad amazing and i was full im not some 100lb waif either trust me all in all this is definitely a place i would go again particularly if my primary aim in eating out is less to fill up and more to relax and enjoy myself which is how eating out should be|1
my daughter got her oil changed in louisville at valvoline where they did not put the drain plug in correctly after driving to ohio we noticed that there was a large amount of oil dripping on the ground where she parked thinking the valvoline in kent would take care of the problem she waited 30 minutes only to be told that the other valvoline dealer did a horrible job and that she should drive 350 miles back there to get it fixed why couldnt they value customer service and correct the problem instead of sending her away and telling her that they didnt have the tools to realign her drain plug|0

i came to this ups store to drop off two boxes with prepaid shipping labels since the boxes were big and heavy i went into the store and asked if they had a trolley i could use they said no since the boxes were prepaid and not a sale for the store i could not use any of their resources i asked if that included having one of their employees give me a hand with the boxes they couldnt give me a hand nor could they loan me a trolley i brought the boxes in myself literally scooting and rolling them into the store it strikes me as rather rigid and unfriendly to refuse to help a 5 foot tall woman manage two heavy boxes on her own particularly when there were two employees present and the store was empty i will not be bringing any business to this store in the future|0

i called castle for a furnace and duct cleaning because my parents have used them in the past and i will definitely be using them in the future they showed up a few minutes before the scheduled appointment were very polite and clean took their shoes off every time they reentered the house and one even asked permission to wash his hands afterwards some areas of the house were less than tidy but they made no comment and when i apologized for the mess they said not to worry and simply moved what they needed to move while they were down there they also checked on the humidifier and advised me that i needed a new one they didnt have any on them but gave me the model number and showed me how to take it out and change it to make sure i could do it on my own their prices were very reasonable and seem to match up or do better than competitors and the service was fantastic|1
ill also agree with the poor layout comments not so good however the staff is all very nice the pharmacy at this particular shoppers is the only one ive been to where they had noninsulin syringes and needles on hand that i could buy immediately without having to order them in considering i have to do im injections that was a nice plus for me|1
if i could buy an apartment directly above nutbar and eat all of my meals there id gladly pay top dollar ive tried almost everything on the menu and have yet to come across anything i dont love the classic avocado toast is a guaranteed favorite the combination of smoked olive oil the salty nutritional yeast is spectacular nutbar has the best coffee in the area definitely drive past the starbucks and get your daily dose at nutbar by the way they have dairy milk and cream which i prefer in my coffee to nut milks but i hear the nut milk is awesome super friendly staff and amazing decor highly recommend to everyone|1
the dented can is one of those places that can really be worth the stop if you driving by i have learned to make a habit of stopping in at least once a week sometimes i hit the jackpot and sometimes i go away empty handed however if your e trying to diet beware this place is loaded with temptations from peppering farm cookies for 100 to 25 cent candy bars recently they have been getting in day old bakery items eg a dozen big chocolate chip muffins for 200 6 bagels for 50 cents cakes tortillas we used to avoid going here because of all the goodies and our lack of self control until they started getting in fresh produce its hit or miss but last week i was able to get organic butter lettuce for only 200 for two heads i have also seen tomatoes oranges potatoes melons avocados chinese peapod i deli fresh large fruit bowls pineapples etc sometimes they arent as fresh as i had hoped but bananas freeze well for smoothies and breadmaking you will also find cold soda for 50 cents cereal salad dressings teas canned goods boxed items 25 cent granola bars and paper items like i said if your near peril ave and with ave stop by you just might hit the motherhood|1

i hired medieval concrete cleaning to remove the efflorescence from our block walls wishing now i would have done it myself with a brush and some vinegar every wall that they cleaned with the pressure washer is now ruined not knowing how to use a pressure washer properly they etched into the blocks removing large amounts of material leaving replacement of the blocks the only true fix thats a lot of money please see pictures attached and posted to yelp i also had them clean one half of the garage floor while they were here and that was mediocre at best no attempt at some sort of barrier between the two sides was made so the chemicals and water splashing and spraying and the cleaning around of stuff made a mess and it looks like crap also i had them clean the paper section on our patio again mediocre with a round shape cleaning machine and a square patio ill let the reader imagine how the corners turned out the wall outside our back door was cleaned differently using a sprayed on chemical it now looks like a spray painted graffiti mess i was told it would likely go away with time and after mentioning money i was given 50 off the bill the total cost was then at 200 the cost for me to now make it look decent i dont know the cost for me to reverse the damage back to normal what are block walls going for these days after staring at all this since april and realizing how bad it is i had to post and now fix|0

and the worst customer service award in phoenix goes to mama gina i dont even know where to start im pretty fair in how i rate businesses on yelp check out my other reviews but let me just say that this place belongs on kitchen nightmares i had purchased a number of restaurant com certificates to this place and used a few of them a while back the pizza was okay but time had passed and we decided to give it another try and use up the remaining certificates id purchased so we entered the restaurant and first thing let them know that we would be dining on one of these restaurant com certificates to which they had no problem they took down the numbers and sat us at a table the server asked us what wed like to order so we went with their white pie as we remembered that being the better of the pizzas wed tried last time he walked away and returned minutes later to inform us that our certificates were no longer valid and asked what wed like to do we told him to give us a moment to think about it and he left us there to go over our options we had a group on purchase with opa life right across the courtyard so we decided to go that route instead we packed up and were about to leave assuming that he put a hold on the order when he approaches us with the pizza we told him to hold off on he realized hed made a mistake and nervously returned the pizza to the kit ken as we were on our way out the door a woman we can only guess was the on duty manager yells at us from across the restaurant to stay put she approaches us and lets us know that she is going to call security on us we are in a moment of shock and explained the situation to her which she should have fully understood as she was the same person wed given the certificates to in the first place but she continued to cause a scene and told us that shell let us go and that she would normally call security on people who dont pay for their food ummm we hadnt even touched the pizza nor did we have any intention of ordering it after discovering the certificates id purchased online were no longer valid as for the server he denied ever coming over to our table and being told to give us a moment what a ridiculous scenario this was ive eaten at many restaurants here in the valley mostly pleasant experiences and never in my wildest would have pictured a manager confronting and threatening to call security for deciding not to dine there it was clearly their mistake and they turned their mistake into an embarrassing and completely uncalled for situation ill never step foot in this business again and i will make sure anyone i know who may consider dining here thinks twice about it update in response to manager owner lists reply lisa you are absolutely right that it was a simple misunderstanding the problem is that a simple misunderstanding turned into an accusatory and embarrassing situation we should have been free to exit the restaurant without being pulled into a dramatic scene initiated by a staff member when the server approached us minutes after ordering to inform us that the certificates that we had explained upon entering the restaurant that wed be dining on were invalid and asked us what wed like to do we told him verbatim give us a few minutes to think it over thank you that should have put a halt on the order and the awkwardness that followed businesses usually practice a customer is always right type of environment and i dont always agree with it but this incident was the polar opposite of that concept initiated by the staff and escalated when they confronted and threatened us in front of other customers ive eaten at many restaurants ive seen good customer service mediocre and bad this was the equivalent of things wed seen on the amy baking company episode of kitchen nightmares|0

i made an appointment 24hrs in advance with 2 vehicles back to back for a tire repair and the other to take a look at my tire balance and see if they could find the reason why my car is wobbling slightly i explained on the phone to the guy that made my appointment what i want looked at on my one car and he said no problem i understand your situation and we will look at it and call you and tell you what we found i said ok and made the appointment for my two cars i dropped one car off for a up appointment and left my keys in and envelope and put it in the dropbox i couldnt write any information on the paper because their pen exploded so i wrote toyota on it as best as i could note during the appointment scheduling the guy on the phone asked for i my full info of the style car and my name and number the next day i didnt hear anything from them so i decide to call them at 4 am the manager told me that since my license plate number was not on the envelope so he said he put my keys in a safe and said he just waits for the customer to call so i know what kind of car it is and then ill pull it in to get worked on so the manager couldnt take the keys out of the envelope and just hit the alarm button to seeing what car is in his parking lot i guess not or see on the schedule that he had a 1 am appointment and if you didnt know what car it was to look in the info to just call me the managers excuse was very poor and they looked at my car and 15 minutes later gave me some stupid excuse on what they found that was wrong with my car and i looked into it afterwards and they were 100 wrong i was lucky enough to get my other vehicles tire repaired just in time before they closed but having to deal with that hassle for a tire patch and my tire balance looked at is unnecessary get new pens in your drop box and look at the schedule info for appointments you have firestone|0

over the last twenty years or so ive come to greenway liquor to get the drinks for any major event that my family has hosted or ive gone to even if driving to them was out of my way i used them because of their customer service and product selection over the years ive referred friends and family to them however the last several visits have swayed my opinion of the store the rude clerk behind the counter who gives off attitude when asking for him to do what hes payed for and gives a discussed look at a paying customer then just puts the merchandise on the counter to the drive up window and clears his throat as his acknowledgment that my order is ready is not appropriate customer service this is a reoccurring event from this person and hes causing a loyal customer of almost twenty years to take her business elsewhere im not the only person that has had this issue with the lack of customer service its a shame because the store used to be about quality service not what its become|0

a friend of a friend suggested to my girlfriend that we check out this college it venue on a friday night we were anticipating a fun girls night that was a happy blend of gin tonics and great music so that we could unwind from a busy work week i checked be and i ger out online and chose to ignore the warnings of past posted reviews lets face it in this day in age everyone thinks their opinion is valid on the world wide web i just like to have my own we roll up there is no line out in front and we are good to stroll right in but before we do bouncers gotta check us out to see that we own proper identification and not trying to sneak in contraband not a problem until there was a problem my friend got checked first and we watched in a we as one of the bouncers was rummaging through in almost of a fisting type motion a flashlight into the bag would have helped screen the contents of the bag but thats just my personal opinion another bouncer ushered me towards her so that i could begin my bag check so i shuffled aside and willingly held my purse open now dont get me wrong i know that this checkpoint is a critical measure in venue security but this was not your usual pat down and bag inspection like in the good ol days i held my purse steady as she checked every nook and cranny she opened up my cigarette pack checked the side zipper pockets rummaged around the bottom to make sure nothing was over looked the usual stuff then i watched her take out my wallet open it up looked flipped through the contents inside and take out a package of zig bags that was buried behind some store gift cards then she closed everything up placed my wallet inside my purse but kept the papers in her hand apparently i am able to cross international boarders with rolling papers but not the threshold of this venue at this point i had to ask are you really taking my papers away from me she indeed was behind me my friend who had passed her body examination had experienced a pat down that would have gotten her boyfriend into jealous fit lets just say it was the kinda frisking that would make ol stool rapper my hammer say cant touch this to sum this up my bouncer told me i could not take my ziggy i into the venue so i chose to keep my compressed tree pulp package and not go in on principle in my entire adult life of heading out and about i have never come across security procedures like i did that night made me think just what kind of a place i was potentially stepping into where girls are touched and groped at the doors of a club and where paper is as dangerous as a crack pipe our night was not at a loss however there are a multitude of bars and venues on college it that have excellent service good music and gin and tonics id be very surprised if i saw this place still up and running on my next visit to college but thats just my opinion i had to post at least 1 star to submit this review but i give be and i ger no is for intelligence a zero star rating for losing my interest before even entering the club|0

this chain food joint has the looks catchy smoothie names but thats really all it has going for it after flying for the past two weeks out of cleveland into i finally jumped on the food options here my recommendation steer clear of all food here pros smoothies get the only star here they use real fruit and you can add additional boosts which is always a plus taste wise im happy cons food wow oh wow is it terrible here i ordered a panini and observed in silent horror as the kitchen worker put what looked like oscar meyer prepackaged sliced ham into a microwave to heat up the resulting product i took back to my gate resembled a total fail soppy mushy inside with nuked tomatoes and ham and upon tasting i threw it away please trust me on this when i say you can do much better at an airport than eat here service i swear the past two times ive been here every i mean every worker looks and acts if they hate their job so damn much theyre just dying to let you know and honestly if your e going to have this hip chic healthy brand image it doesnt help when your workers look like death call me silly but when the workers at a healthy food joint have that terrible of an image i start questioning the quality of the food im getting seriously cash register girl lose the dude or go work at mcdonalds where i wouldnt care how you treated me as long as i got my food quickly hungry go to the bar one gate down and grab some greasy bar food rather than wasting your appetite and money on u food if you want something light then i would say drop by u food for a smoothie just dont be too surprised to see the terribly unhappy cash register girl yelling at the even more unhappy smoothie girl to make your damn smoothie|0

its subway the food is the food what i really cant get past is the staff at this place i stop here on my way home from work often and almost every time i stop the staff surprises me with something new and inappropriate whether its sexual conversations between employees or just a total lack of regard for me the customer i am never disappointed|0

we just moved to calgary so naturally we needed internet in our new home we had a tells rep come to the house to install it and he did so unsuccessfully not to mention outside of the time window provided we were very kind offering drinks and attempting to communicate with him but felt a lack of communication on his end he left the house for a while to sit in the tells truck so i asked my husband to go see what was going on my husband asked the man nicely to simply come tell us whats going on before he left and encouraged him to take his time to do what was necessary the tells rep left without any communication leaving us with unanswered questions and an unfinished job so i called the customer service line and reported what happened in order for answers and to get internet asap i kept getting sent from person to person without any progress and it took days to speak with a member of management we were then told they could do it in another week and we would get 2 months free it is not about the money you cant fix poor customer service and ignorance with money people need internet to work my husband is a health care professional in canada and internet is a simple yet necessary tool that he uses to help others with their health this simple failed service put others health at risk luckily the lovely coffee shops in our neighbourhood had no problem with him using up their bandwidth while having many long breakfasts and lunches there so we went with shaw they came they installed they conquered i will now be cancelling my tells cell and suggesting friends and family to use other providers as tells is all talk and no action thank you shaw for providing us with proper and efficient service with positive results|0

it is my first time visiting montreal i went to this place because i saw it on yelp when i walked in the service was slow but didnt think much about it the place was packed our waiter started off my greeting us and taking our order we ordered the beer sampler to tried the nine small beer samples they recommended and we ordered our food after we finished the beer sampler we order our first draft beer and started eating our food this is when we started noticing the bad service the waiter had forgotten our draft drinks he seemed to be in a rush and taking other drinks to other tables he looked at us after we finished our meal and said oops the waiter then brought us our draft beers that we each ordered we drank our beers and then we asked for the bill the waiter brought us our bill when we reviewed the bill we noticed he had charged us for two extra drinks we brought this error to his attention and he then started to argue with us he looked at us and rolled his eyes and said whatever why in the world would we question a bill i felt super offended by his attitude and his back forth arguing i was shocked when we tried to bring it up again he looked at us and said it doesnt matter to me and he then shaked his head word of advice mister waiter we are tourists and are actually going places to spend money we would not question a bill if it werent true we were actually looking to order additional drinks but decided not to due to the slow service i for sure will never go to this place again due to the lack of respect and professionalism not to mention the super slow service this is by far my worst experience in montreal that ive had|0
we were very pleased with the electrical service that mister sparky performed at our house the technician who came out tyler was on time friendly helpful and thorough in his diagnosis and repair work he fixed our issues in no time at all he also performed a free home inspection which he found a couple of breakers in my panel that were not up to code and replaced immediately i have a brand new home and yet it still didnt measure up to mister sparky i standard for quality work we were also very happy with chris who we spoke with in the office very friendly and scheduled our appointment within a time frame that was acceptable with my busy schedule thanks again mister sparky you are definitely my go to electrician|1
this location is very slow i walked in and stood at the counter for a solid couple minutes before one of the two behind the counter even acknowledged me they need to go train with the ith it and willets a as they have spectacular energy and chia toner service|0
it may be a case of mini hoarding but its new to me has tons of stuff im a fan i have found so many treasures over the past few years rugs furniture pillows ive bought it all over time and gotten tons of compliments on my style they always have new stuff and they seem to have a good reputation in the area because theyre always overflowing with merchandise my only negative is that i get frustrated when the artwork isnt stored very well and consequently gets scratched up|1
i place my order via the internet the website is very user friendly not a lot of unnecessary questions pizza tracker on the website is pretty cool with the exception of the quality check for whatever reason this store seems to skip that step i have posted a picture of the pizza that was delivered not very appetizing the wings could have used a little more time in the oven i rated my experience on their website and to my surprise within minutes i was contacted by a manager that goes by the name of talmadge he was able to handle my concerns in a professional manner for that reason my review goes from 1 star to 4|1
the owner hates his job he makes that clear so i have a hard time believing he or his similarly apathetic staff likes the pets so disinterested in listening to client requests that he essentially dismisses any instructions or questions with a wave of the hand but the worst and inexcusable part is the aesthetic physical and emotional state of my dogs when they have been returned to me three times i will never go back after having one dog deeply cut another returned with a huge grease dye stain that had to grow out before it could be removed by trimming and a third returned with an either injured or infected eye in the last two instances i asked questions and was met with denial or blame this place doesnt give a crap about the animals and they dont even make them look good if you want your pets to be just as unhappy as the staff bring them here if you care about their wellbeing stay away|0
i have been going to this place on and off since 2007 when i was first introduced to caribbean food the customer service is so so but the food is sooo good my favourite is the roti chicken and my newest love is their stew chicken to die for if you are in the area its totally worth the detour|1

ahah map valet guys just when you think this suck ass garage cant get any worse the map valet guys prove you wrong by driving 40 mah up the ramp take up all of the spots that the suckers like me pay for every month and then beep the horn of the persons car they are parking while riding your ass because your e only going 10 mah faster than the recommended speed limit god what a privilege to pay 160 a month just shoot me now and put me out of my misery|0
good pizza at a great price the unique crust thats both crispy and airy is probably not for everybody but our whole group liked it the sauce is good too light but with a good tomato flavor the best thing about this place is the management they went out of their way for our group of seven and the food was out fast and the prices we fed everybody in under 40 with plenty of leftovers taken home|1
this plastic surgery practice medi spa clinic believes in the bait and switch method of treating roping clients in and then farming them out even their address is misleading they are in hornbill not toronto they told me by phone that they could treat me i am a us citizen i stressed that i would be traveling a very long distance i was put on hold for several minutes so the person i spoke with could check if they treated non canadians i was told they did but after i traveled a very long distance suddenly they didnt have insurance to treat non canadians i was sent to a medi spa a block away was given a sales pitch for something far inferior to what i traveled for and was overcharged at that oh and on the way out of the medi spa the doctor was in the medi spa office probably to pick up his exorbitant referral fee way to mislead your clients victims what a scam horribly horribly disappointing waste of 2000 in addition to my travel costs and time avoid like the plague no one needs a dishonest doctor|0
this store used to be the bomb it has a recent death blow though it went from being corporate with very friendly staff and fair prices to a franchise store prices hiked up less friendly service the kid tonight was too busy looking at face time on his phone to ask how i was doing or treat me like a human a lot of new rules no more bathroom for the public no more hot food on grill food after 10 am if i didnt live right next store i would not go back ovoid this store at all costs|0

dont bother wasting your time shopping in this store at northlake mall especially if its for someone else because they will not make your returns exchanges an easy or pleasant experience they are more than happy to take your money on the front end but god help you if you have to return and or exchange something my husband purchased two items a shirt and a peacoat for me as christmas gifts from this store as most people who shop here know they are one of the higher priced stores in the mall and its not uncommon to pay between 7590 just for a top you would think they would be a bit more helpful when it comes to the after sale when someone needs to ex ange not so as my husband and i found out i was able to exchange the shirt for a different size but another color however the coat was another story because it was on sale when he bought it and they didnt have anymore in the store the sales associate who was doing our exchange made it seem like there was nothing she could do for us i guess were supposed to be stuck with an overpriced coat in the wrong size we had called before coming in and spoke with someone different who had told us that they didnt have one but another store did and they could do a charge send to us that was fine for us but once we got into the store the girl who was supposed to be helping us was acting like it was not only an inconvenience that she had to call another store but actually had the nerve to tell my husband twice very sarcastically you just need to bring her in next time obviously doing her job was too much to ask i guess unemployment or government aid must ve been easier i worked retail for 8 years and was a manager for 3 of them and the quickest way to lose customers is to make them feel like theyre an inconvenience well tell you what bebe store at northlake you dont have to worry about me or my husband shopping there anymore ill take my business to the south park mall store and its my guess that your store at northlake will be out of business within the next year or two good riddance|0
what a great place for curios they are extremely knowledgeable and personable no pressure but they were available to answer questions after seeing the selection we revised our original plan and bought 2 curios|1
grab and go or stay and chat this is a great edition to the area traditional lasagna 350 slice or 21 a tray of 6 slices was an amazing find during their soft opening this past weekend just picked up breakfast and lunch for 2 people for under 20 orange marmalade muffin was moist and not too sweet while the hash brown muffin bacon or veggie i cheese 150 each was crispy on the outside and moist and soft inside cant wait to try the poppy seed dressing on the house salad for lunch since they sell all their home made dressings by the pint too the pint of mac and cheese waiting for the hubble to try when he gets home is a good deal for 4 there was 1 tray available in the cooler to go we havent tried the soup or sandwiches and the mini meat loaves are calling out for an errand day dinner sooo many choices one star off for a couple of things that keep me from becoming a daily addict the salads are a bit steep at 4 for what looks like only iceberg lettuce picture uploaded here and they didnt have foil containers that fit the lasagna they offer call ahead heat up service so having a foil container would be important if this had been a drive by in the afternoon expecting to deliver hot noodle goodness without melting the plastic pastry container to a waiting dinner table all and all a really great find oh did i mention the cupcakes oh yeah they have cupcakes review will be updated when those are gone tonight|1
i work for a company that deals with towing vehicle out of this body shop usually we have to call in and find out what the payout is and confirm a few more things in order to pick up a very rude man by the name of raymond answered and was using foul language as if we arent working very unprofessional this guy was his attitude was disgusting from the start find someone else to repair your vehicle customer service is horrible unsure of how these douche bags are still in business|0

every time my family and i went to las vegas wed go to this restaurant cos there werent many good argentine places near us but whatever good it used to be is fading fast my parents got asado and even though it was a little pink despite asking for it well done it was decent the mole jas were good the chimichurri was great the bread seemed to be heated up in a microwave and was soft the ricotta ravi ones i got were hard and pretty bad i couldnt even finish the plate the masa of the empanadas were kinda doughy and unpleasant the day i went there were three women working one waitress was sweet the other was just having a bad day i guess i didnt get a refill on my drink til i was done eating and i can understand that when your e busy you forget but come on they checked on us twice throughout the whole meal if you want something be sure to shout for it overall if you just want argentine cuisine for a decent price and arent expecting a 4 star meal this is the place for you i used to really love this place so im hoping they just had a bad day and will get back on track but as of right now im not planning to stop by next time im in town|0
i drive by this place often and decided to try i believe that a place ought to be able to stand by its plain cheese pizza amos didnt impress and the service backs up my low review i called in to order do you sell by the slice yes so i order 4 pieces guy is gruff and says 6 dollars so i head that way they are a cash only business which is primitive at last i i pay and grab the box i ask to use the restroom they dont have one i ask if there is just a sink to wash my hands in they dont have a sink i ask for a napkin or paper towels and they havent even got those despite this failure of resources may be my pizza will rock no rather than 4 i had 8 tiny squares ex inches bland crust bland sauce bland cheese there is no reason to patronize this place for pizza and based on other aspects of my fair goat it im not worried about trying the other food|0

auto hall is the worst place to go if your e looking for a stand up place for a used vehicle trust me keep searching im so disgusted and sick about my purchase from auto hall or their finance company credit acceptance my fianc and i bought a 2014 dodge avenger from auto hall with only 64000 miles figured it might be my last car as i am 78 and living on social security we thought we had found our dream car it looked great and drove the same way or so we thought we purchased the vehicle on august 24 2018 and paid for the warranty thru the credit issuing agency brian of auto hall said all repairs would only require a 100 payment just a scam the cars engine seized up on september 18 2018 less than 30 days later and not only are we out of a vehicle but the money we paid as well and the credit agency still wants their 14000 not considering the car would require a 6000 engine at my expense apparently the engine overheated and it was pointed out that despite what brian said overheating is not covered and a diagnostic fee is required in addition to the 100 another 500 bill i know the fine print says we are screwed even tho we only had use of the car for a little over three weeks now everyone washes their hands of the issue saying yes it is unfortunate that the 14000 car will now cost you 21300 if we could pay it once you purchase the car auto hall and credit acceptance washed their hands of it obviously there was something wrong with the car before we bought it brian never gave me all the information about the insurance and now we apparently are screwed out of 5 stars i had to check 1 obviously they get zero as far as im concerned|0
until recently i saw karla lambert at studio charge for over a year for my hair i initially hesitated to write this review because im not the type of customer who complains about the level of service she gets as a consistently loyal and patient client it takes a lot for me to give someone a bad review that being said this one star review is more than warranted and i would say even being generous at best ill state my main issues with the type of service you will receive as a whole and the incident which prompted me to write this review in the first place 1 timeliness is a consistent problem with karla i would always show up on time or early for my appointments only to have to wait 10 or 15 minutes before she even began on my hair because she was still working on another client or if i was the first appointment of the day because she was not on time 2 she double books appointments i can only assume to make more money so your e not getting personalized service additionally taking twice as long for your service to be completed personally i dont enjoy paying for a high end salon service and not getting the undivided attention i deserve especially at the exorbitant prices she charges according to her all hair stylists in her building do this but shes the only one ive ever been to who works on two clients at the same time ive never before had a stylist who does this 3 karla is more interested in answering phone calls texting and looking at social media instead of engaging with her clients her personal life takes precedence over the person sitting in her chair the incident that caused this review was due to the last service i will ever have with her im a natural blonde but i like to be platinum cool blonde this isnt a difficult task many past stylists of mine have had no problem achieving the color i request i can only assume this is because they actually use foil whereas karla simply put bleach on my head to the point where i have a horribly burned scalp and yellow hair so now i have been walking around for the past few days with what looks like a horrible self administered dye job because my scalp could not take the burning karla was unable to finish the process and instructed me to come back in a week when the reason i went in to her to begin with was an event i need to look resplendent for tomorrow luckily i already have an appointment elsewhere to clean up this mess i texted her a polite message to ask for a refund so i could have someone else fix the job 145 is not a small amount of money and if you make a mistake id rather go somewhere else to correct the problem i was returned with a phone call that was a flat out defensive rude refusal to refund me she claimed she would be willing to fix my hair but offered no remorse or understanding even though she knew i was clearly upset had she been a touch more sympathetic and provided patient personal service this review might never have been posted bottom line if you provide a service to a client and funds are requested back due to unsatisfactory services and you want to go somewhere else to get it fixed money should have been refunded end of story if you want to spend your hard earned money on an extremely expensive impersonal salon service and unprofessional attitude then you will get exactly what you pay for trash i will be taking my business elsewhere and so should you|0

i had been going to this dentist for over a year when i realized it was time to switch the problems in a nutshell not gentle not thorough unfortunately this was to the detriment of my dental health do hood noticed i had inflammation on one of my gums during a regular visit and he prescribed some steroids i did not use them as i avoid that kind of thing and i figured there was a cause and the steroids would just be helping with the symptoms the inflammation went away on its own but came back a few months later the next time i went in i told them about it they did nothing as well i had fillings twice when i had them done they put a block in my mouth to hold my mouth open wider i have a hard time opening wide it really hurts my jaw one time the dentist did that when he finished i almost couldnt re close my jaw thats when i realized i had the wrong dentist i switched to another dentist female that also works on children they never need a block to work on my teeth and never hurt my jaw like that now the big deal is this at the new dentist they found i had a large amount of plaque built up under the gum that had been getting inflamed it was obvious the previous dentist hadnt been getting it cleaned and it had been building up for a long time they found two spots where this had happened too bad for me it caused my bone to regress in those area and they said it wont grow back now i know a bad dentist is a really big deal|0

by far the worst place out there i rented a room and it was too run down to stay in after paying i walked into the room then walked immediately back to the office and asked for a refund or even a partial refund they declined and told me there was nothing they could do i explained there was drug para than iliac dirty sheets no door handle on the bathroom wires hanging from the ceiling and mold in the bathroom they told me that was on the maintenance list for things that needed done and it shouldnt affect my stay needless to say i had to get the police involved if at all possible do not stay here|0
overpriced below average selection of flowers and vases delivered arrangement was different than described on the phone when i called to follow up the person i spoke with went through the price breakdown and apologized that the arrangement was not as discussed but did not offer any solution just an apology i wish i had read the other yelp review left it would have prevented this mess nothing like accidentally sending someone a yucky flower arrangement to thank them for their generosity tough to find a great florist these days|0
i bought my future wifes ring there about a year and a half ago and it was a seamless process i went in picked out the diamond the setting and went back a few days later to pay a deposit in cash got the call a few days later saying the ring was ready went there paid the balance again in cash and got the ring we both love it and we are very satisfied customers i have referred several friends to get their rings there|1

amazing yeah no one usually uses the word amazing and dentist in the same sentence but do collins at clinique entire la cite definitely deserves the praise i went to do collins as a new resident of montreal and had no clue for what a great experience i was in for i had previously gone to a dentist in chicago and knew that i needed a crown on a tooth that had previously undergone a root canal do collins is by far the best dentist i have ever gone to he made sure to make me feel comfortable and was very aware of how anxious i was about the procedure he talked to me about all my options never pressured me and took the procedure at a slower pace that i could handle his office is gorgeous and has a panoramic view of it royal and the canal it is located on the ith floor of the transit tower which is across the street from parc jeanne mance and parc mount royal what a view completely different than most dentist offices which resemble dungeons more than anything else he put on a movie for me to watch while he was doing the procedure it definitely helped me take my mind off of everything and eased my anxiety his assistant was super sweet and chatted with me before and after making me feel comfortable and not worried im soooo ooo glad i somehow found do collins he made the whole experience painless in every way|1
i was a homeowner with a problem a skunk had burrowed under the concrete slab of our home and left a big hole after calling multiple area foundation specialists and pumping companies i finally found scott at action pumping every other company blew me off it was either too small a job or they wanted to charge an arm and a leg one company even wanted me to rent and work the pump scott actually took the time to talk with me assumed i knew nothing about concrete pumping which i dont and walked me through the entire process both scott and the concrete showed up on time and without incident action pumping sold me on their customer experience and scotts personal touch they werent the cheapest nor were they the most expensive but even if they were the customer experience would be worth every cent|1

we had a horrible experience as renters with this company we kept out place very clean had no kids or pets and constantly cleaned the carpets when we moved to a nicer place we hired the maid service they practically guarantee will meet their standards at 300 of course the maid was very rude and guess what o is his thought the place wasnt clean enough further we had the patio and front professionally done by a gardner and had the carpets freshly and professionally washed while on the move out inspection the guy seemed pretty nice and said everything looked good but as it turns out the company kept 800 out of our security deposit they said it was for repainting the walls and cleaning the garage floors we considered that was regular wear and tear of a property that had been rented for around 4 years so we wrote back having briefly consulted with an attorney their response not only contained spelling mistakes seriously but was rude as well we figured we would not stoop to their level and file suit at a small claims court however it yelp ers must know how unprofessional these people are and how frustrated we felt after leaving fortunately we never have to deal with them ever again|0
went here 3 times during week long stay in toronto food is so fresh and made custom to order very accommodating to vegans salad rolls are the best ive ever had service couldnt be any nicer lovely family run restaurant cant recommend enough|1
first time having their sandwich without the bun pretty amazing if you ask me i think it was fresh hearty i got the turkey bacon mayo it was very filling fresh id go back again without question|1
the service was not spectacular started ordering with one guy he walked away and another jumped in then we ordered the chicken parm and was sadly disappointed to find out that it was pretty much a frozen processed chicken breast the only good tasting items were the breadsticks and the side salad that we could have easily made at home|0
even the best food cant make up for poor service and the food at shish cafe wasnt good enough to even come close to making up for it we waited and waited then were rushed through ordering werent checked on and had to flag our server down like a taxi during rush hour to get the check i had the chicken kabob the chicken was juicy with good seasoning the hummus was bland to me and my whole dish looked like it had been slopped on the plate my husband liked his lamb stew but wasnt anything to write home about all in all for the price 40 for two no apps no drinks i wont eat here again im surprised that this has 45 stars especially in madison where decent restaurants are pretty easy to come by disappointed about it was hoping this would be the place to come for great mediterranean food|0
today was my first and probably last time stepping into an ann taylors there were several things that went wrong with my visit first they had a buy one get the second 50 off sale except the 50 off tops was highlighted while the buy one get one part was in small almost not readable font it was the first time i had fallen for something like this next time ill be far more careful reading then the lady at the cashier commented on how nice the material of the blouse was i said my honest opinion that the blouse was just ok she proceeded to lecture me on how great the materials they use are and how i shouldnt like all cotton shirts because they shrink and suck seriously i didnt come to a store to get lectured on clothing materials i know my fabrics and prefer around 95 or more in cotton with a mix of some artificial materials for stretch brooks brothers make great shirts with this kind of fabric mix which remain wrinkle free and dont shrink at all i dont think im ever coming to an ann taylors again with the condescending service they offer no thanks|0

basically my friend and i felt like we got catfish ed cheap my friend and i got a tart each and since there werent any seating tables there we asked for a bag the lady handed me a clear plastic bag when i was expecting the generic purple flat bottom fancy bag so i asked for a bigger bag for each of us and all she gave me was a bigger version of the clear bag my friend ended up and asking her for the proper bag our tarts wouldve gotten destroyed or toppled over if we used the clear bags so we felt like they were holding them bag for whatever reason expectations is reality my friend ordered the ma carbon hot chocolate which as advertised to be beautiful pink and full of sprinkles and two pink macaroons all she got was a half cracked brown ma carbon on top and nothing even close to what was shown on social media poster at the cafe however my drink happened to look okay didnt taste too good though and the girl after me ordered the exact same thing as me and it was terrible because her drink was very sad looking since they used the remainder sprinkles whip for mine ordering i placed my order and they took a while making it which im fine since it was pretty decorative but they didnt take my friends order right away after mine until they finished making my stuff first wouldve been smarter to take all orders and get them done then when they handed my friend her drink they didnt even remember if they gave her the tart yet which they didnt taste mine is both on the right in the photo my drink was the fairy something hot chocolate i didnt like it at all i threw it out after 15 of it my tarte was a bit soggy just not for me didnt finish it either overall inconsistent doesnt taste amazing average less than average service wouldnt go back|0
my go to in this neighbourhood everything ive tried is so good but the salads keep me coming back the staff is so friendly and treat everyone as though they were a regular|1
no wonder sears is verging on bankruptcy again i will never use their services again i purchased new windows from sears i received quotes from two other reputable companies but chose sears based on price and having the better financing option i ordered 7 windows and one set of french doors the windows arrived in the time frame promised by the salesman the contractor called me to arrange a date and time for installation we agreed on february 8 900 am for him to start work he called me shortly before 900 and said he was running late and would be there at 1100 instead of course 1100 came and went without even a phone call arranging a new time and he didnt show until 130 he started installing the windows and had been at the house for 90 minutes and installed two windows when i looked at the windows on his trailer and assumed i was short one window after some back and forth i determined i was missing the french doors i asked him where they were and he said i dont know but that his boss knew they were missing he offered to call his boss and get a status for me but he didnt follow up i was angry because i didnt receive a phone call telling me they were missing he didnt tell me they were missing when he showed up at my house and started to work its like he was trying to hide it he showed up the following day thursday to finish installing the rest of the windows when he arrived thursday morning i asked him if he had the doors he said no i asked him where they were and was told there was clerical error after more questioning on my part i figured out the doors were never ordered in the first place i was furious i was told it would take 18 days for the doors to arrive i called sears on february 27 18 days later exactly and was told the doors had arrived we arranged for installation on friday march 3 at 900 sound familiar of course 900 came and went i got a call around 1230 from sears telling me they had unwrapped the crate around the door and discovered one of the panes was broken and the door would have to be reordered i asked how long will that take and i was told not long sears offered to call me later that day or monday with a date i never got a phone call this is the worst customer service ever its no wonder sears is struggling i will never again use sears for anything and strongly recommend you think twice before using them|0

i have been to this restaurant several times in the last couple of weeks and have had consistently wonderful service and great food the restaurant is clean and well lit when i was shown to my table last night the host made a point of giving the table another wipe down just to be sure several people asked to make sure i was enjoying my meal and i was even offered a newspaper or magazine when they saw i was dining alone|1

i have never done the teeth whitening with light before but i got a group on and thought what the heck i decided to make an appointment though when i arrived i realized they had 4 stations and had room for me anyway the woman manning the booth was very nice and very professional and made me feel at home right away there is a very specific process when we went through and i put a plastic mouthpiece in and began the whitening i wont say its the most fun ive ever had to hold my mouth still with the mouthpiece in for 20 minutes but it wasnt bad and was certainly worth the results fyi bring your ipod my teeth were stained from daily coffee and i wanted a jumpstart to brighten them up and i certainly got my moneys worth the results were instantly visible and im very satisfied i plan to continue some at home whitening now and possibly go back to pro white for another treatment whether you want a jumpstart before doing some home whitening or just want a quick brightening to take a few years off your appearance pro white fits the bill for a professional pleasant and very effective solution|1
if you read nothing else of this review read this do not walk away from this salon run i came in for a partial foil highlight i was greeted by my stylist i think her name was rachel after i sat down and we talked about what kind of coloring i wanted she scoffed at my roots uh sorry that im on a college budget lady after that we both realized that we had nothing in common and she stayed relatively silent the whole time after i was rinsed off she asked me if i wanted my hair blow dried how else would i have seen my color she blow dried my hair and sent me to the front desk where my grand total was 120 ok so 75 for highlights 20 for a shine treatment almost 30 to blow dry my hair are you serious i also wasnt informed that i would be charged for this fyi i got home reexamined my hair and noticed there were patches of my hair that hadnt been dyed there were chunky highlights next to thin ones no clear pattern whatsoever i called the salon complained and scheduled a redo i came in a few days later where i had a different stylist michelle who was very rude and gave off the impression that i had done something wrong i was rinsed went up to the desk to check out and was told verbatim your e free to leave now i walked out of the salon insulted with soaking wet hair horrible just plain horrible i wouldnt recommend this salon to anyone|0
sign advertising buy one get one hats so we went in for golden knights hats they were excluded because they are selling so well fine i get it but at least have another sign by the initial sign so we arent shocked at a 6000 total at the register for that price we might as well buy at the arena and have a better selection|0
i went here with a friend of mine yesterday i had seen this place but never actually went in well i love a cigar every now and then so we thought we would try it we ordered wings drinks and cigars well they brought me my friends wings and told me they were mine like i said i had never been there so i took the man at his word i started eating the wings well when the rest of the wings didnt come out we told the bartender he looks in the computer then looks at me and very nasty says those are his wings then walks away before i have a chance to respond he then comes back with my wings and fries and puts them down then my friend says i still dont have my wings by then the guy who dropped off the wings is there so i start to explain the bartender then says your kinda eating his wings sooo i was livid however i didnt want to ruin the night and the manager did try to smooth it over which got them an extra star we dealt with another bartender for the rest of the night service is important to me much more important than even food and ambience i will not go back|0
well to start off when i enter a store and expect to get greeted its usually by a friendly face a smile not an employee that mumbles hello no smile doesnt look to thrilled to be at work second when paying for my transaction i expect my credit card to be handed back to me not thrown on the counter i find it very rude and im actually turned off just by this one visit my first and last time at this store ill take my business elsewhere customer service is a difficult industry if you cant at least greet with a smile or better yet hand the customer their card not throw it in the counter may be your e in the wrong business|0
i was here a couple of times for team lunches both the times i liked the food it is such a vibrant place food is fresh and light yet filling the last time i was here i ordered roasted veggie sandwich with chick pea salad i liked the food and i am sure i will go back again things to remember 1 they are busy during lunch hours and you should be prepared to wait for at least 10 minutes for your food to arrive 2 if you are planning to go in a group make sure you are there before the rush hour to easily find a table for everyone at one place 3 dont hesitate to order the biq sliders if they are offering my colleagues were happy with the sliders they ordered|1
if you want someone that doesnt want to work with your child in a way that they learn and you want them to yank your child around do paperwork during your childs sessions scold and give your other children dirty looks make you uncomfortable when they call you into their office when you simply signed the thumbs up from the glass observance window in a way to ask if everything was good give you a bunch of attitude when you ask what goals she is working on and she relays none ith session and youve been waiting for a copy of the goals for a month questions what school your child is going to and not believing you because you had to miss a friday app because you no longer have them off not get back to you promptly to reschedule an appointment not be understanding when your child is sick then this is the place for you previous to this woman quitting on my son i could sense that she was angry towards me it was all over her body language and facial expressions why i was uncertain i asked her if there was something she wanted to talk about because i could feel the tension she told me no but i was not convinced i believe this all stemmed from my asking if she could allow my son freedom to move about the room rather than force him to sit at a table although he did interact with her more by being able to move around and she stated this i felt that she was mad about being on the floor and following him around lazy eventually she just let him do whatever he wanted and she had no control over the session she went over and grabbed her paperwork and criss cross applesauce on the floor and was in her own little world doing paperwork during his therapy time after several minutes of her doing paperwork and not paying any attention to my son i asked if she was done working with him she flipped her top she told me that she was done and it wasnt going to work out i told her im sorry that she felt that way i was tired i was exhausted and i didnt want to argue with an adult sized temper tantrum baby especially in front of my children so i packed up and started out the door she said your mad about the make up time i told her no i simply wanted to schedule the make up hour when she had an available spot then she added that she didnt feel that i trusted her with my son that was just something to make her feel better if i didnt trust her with my son we wouldnt have been there in the first place and we would have been the one to quit not her but due to her lack of professionalism that day i would have eventually found better help for my child shes also contracted with did and since she quit on my son i went ahead and let did know im sure she had some answering to do its very disappointing as a parent when your e seeking the best help for your nonverbal child and it ends up like this no goals no patience lazy only in the business for money|0

im not a fan of chain restaurants however i love going out for breakfast and ive discovered that trying to find a small independently owned place in the se quadrant that we live in is not easy weve eaten at humpty i a couple of times found it average and not much to write about until our last visit i love eggs benedict love love love them id eat hollandaise sauce with a spoon if you served it on the menu i love it so much sure its not healthy but truth be told i dont care so when i go for breakfast if eggs benny are on the menu chances are ill order them the first two visits to this restaurant were fine the food was fine the coffee was fine it stayed in our repertoire for days when we didnt want to make breakfast at home until this time third time is definitely not a charm for this restaurant a near empty restaurant and poor slow service greeted us the minute we sat down that coffee which had been fine now turned terrible the benny ive ordered in the past yolks always medium was terrible i know that their hollandaise is not from scratch so its odd they screwed it up yolks rock hard despite the fact i was asked the hubby i simple breakfast wasnt much better he was served rye toast that tasted like the bottom of a shoe it was obviously stale and had no flavour whatsoever for the record his yolks were perfect what topped off this terrible meal was the lack of service from our server food was dropped off and we never saw her again until she brought the cheque and she barely thanked us at that time perhaps my dissapointed attitude about my meal was enough to keep her away all in all it was 30 minutes and 30 dollars i will never get back|0

i can not give this store even 1 star their after sale service is horrible their products are of such poor quality that they can not stand behind them i bought a leather sofa set and i also purchased their protection plan which is a scam after 3 years the leather on the love seat started to fade into an or angy color i sent them an email stating that i wanted the love seat changed the protection plan was to cover that and they responded that it was normal wear and tear in what universe is it normal for dark brown leather to turn orange they refused to do anything about it it is the last dollar they will i ever see from me and if people are smart they will avoid the brick and go ashley furniture instead they give fantastic service before and after sale|0

this place is clean kind and so patient i was in literally this morning and i feel the need to leave a good review right now i came in for my appointment this morning and had an insurance issue arise that i probably shouldve taken care of prior to arriving but i didnt each staff was so incredibly kind and patient waiting for the issue to be resolved prior to them seating me in a chair an hour later not their fault 100 my own i was expecting them to send me away and to come back again nope they each greeted me with a smile and still took their time with me i know i messed up their schedule but they didnt make me feel like an inconvenience once i have insecurity with my teeth and do sam and ari looked me in the eye and told me i am beautiful the way i was built and to not spend my money on fixing an insecurity i wanted to cry no one has ever said that to me before this place is wonderful it certainly needs more good reviews|1
disappointed with condition at burial plots of mother and father talked with management over four times during a twelve week period of time and no action has been taken to resolve conditions 2013 mission statement implies that their motto is for remembering a life with dignity i believe dignity supports fixing problem areas the original vases for our parents have been missing for years the replacement vases are now gone this makes leaving flowers and other items for your loved one near to impossible i want some resolution not just in action|0

i went to target at stonecrest tonight to buy a belt but i ended up finding some other items i needed and spent about 120 when i was trying to check out the first line i got in the clerk had some issue with the cash register from the customer in front of me so i waited for about a minute and saw the issue was not going to be resolved anytime soon so i went to another register and the clerk there was scanning items so slow it was painful and i was third in line so i moved to a another register no one else in line yea i greeted the clerk and addressed him by name we will call him bob not his real name bob completely ignored me until he finally got ready to start scanning my items and just to be clear it was a good 10 seconds before he said anything to me and then he said something like hello i dont remember exactly but it was very brief but friendly the belt i came in for originally would not scan a message came up on the register that said enter price so bob asked me if i knew the price i had no idea because there was no price sticker on the belt he got ready to call a price check and i told him to forget it im not going to stand there and wait so target you lost a sale because of incompetence incompetence not from bob but from targets inefficiencies actually you lost more than one sale because i would have bought more seven dollar shirts had i known that they only cost seven dollars but i didnt know that because there was no price on them i asked a very friendly clerk back in the mens department how much they cost and they could not tell me they told me in a very friendly manner i could scan them at one of the price scanners which are conveniently located throughout the store so a brief segue i visit target about twice a year i know you have conveniently located price scanners but what am i a customer or an employee its not my job to figure out the price of your product seriously do you want to know why com is kicking your butt just keep rereading this paragraph and youll have the tip of the iceberg it took at least 15 minute to check out when i finally got checked out i looked back at the first register and they were still waiting for a manager to come and help with whatever problem they had so let me back up the dressing room i used was dirty and in need of repair there were no hooks on the wall to hold my clothes because the hooks had been pulled off the wall and the floor was nasty the person working in the mens department was very pleasant but seemed to be completely clueless when i asked for assistance i dont blame the employees in the store its obvious management and corporate just dont care and im sure the attitude trickles down to the employees in fact it seems the employees at this location are on slow down look it up wikipedia has a good article corporate if your e reading this you need to realize the biggest advantage you have over com is personal customer service and you are squandering that you need to figure this out or in 10 years you will be a memory attached are pictures of your dirty floor and broken hooks|0
previously i gave this restaurant 5 stars not anymore our last service was terrible it was my moms birthday and i felt so bad that we got such crappy service the bedpan cook didnt make the fried rice or the shrimp he did a half a job preparing the food the server barely checked on us and he brought out my moms birthday dessert when she was still eating dinner we felt like a nuisance to the entire staff we need to find a new bedpan restaurant so disappointing|0

horrible i would give 0 stars if i could i went in last week for a pedicure however i explained that i did not need any polish cut file since i had just had a gel shellac pedicure a few days prior they understood and went about a pedicure minus the polish file etc the actual pedicure was just fine and they did what i asked however when i went to pay they charged me for a full standard pedicure 30 i explained to the man at the register that i did not have a full pedicure the man was very rude and explained that polish cut was included but could not provide any additional reasoning for this policy this wasnt about the money for me it was about their complete lack of customer service i will never be back again and thats too bad since i live in the neighborhood i hope this salon gets shut down and a better salon takes its place|0
the owner is the bald asian guy at the cash register who talks bad about his customers right in their face in another language and thinks we didnt understand very rude very disrespectful he says hes specialized in vietnamese food yet they cant make a decent soup the worst toki noise soup in canada his general tao is fried over cooked and has no taste their grilled meats are okay but they are served thin as paper so you cant notice its not the best choice cuts available the restaurant is in dire need of renovations this place is open for his lexus payments and could care less about what he serves and who it goes to a total loser|0

i got an engagement ring and both wedding bands custom made here i found the staff to be very helpful and insightful and eager to help spritz specializes in diamonds and reading the reviews here people are going to them to do unusual things and complaining that they arent knowledgeable if you want diamonds or custom jewelry with real quality the staff will even show you rating scales of the stones you choose and help you make the perfect piece if you go in with something cheap from mexico they will tell you theres nothing they can do because they have much higher standards this is the perfect place to go if you want to find the perfect jewelry at the right price and you know that its going to be the highest quality i was very satisfied with my visit and i would recommend spritz to anyone|1

several 1 star reviews about the home shop and its owner michele brown says it all prior to renting a home from this woman and her management company i had been renting a house for years with no problems and rent paid on time every time that all changed when i moved here 2 eviction notices 1 with grounds i had enough of her mouth and threats to evict over things she had no grounds to evict for so i withheld rent however the homeowners intervened and i stayed 1 without rent was paid several nasty phone calls and emails from michele brown herself and all of the 1 star reviews back up that it was the worst mistake of my life thankfully a home is being purchased for me so i never have to worry about renting again but i will be creating a website with all of the details and email proof of why this woman is a nightmare has no communication skills business skills and shouldnt be allowed to speak on the phone or email any of her tenants shes slow on paying for repairs tries to goad tenants into paying for repairs and maintenance the management company should be paying for and has constant threats of eviction if you dont instantly bow down to her bullying the home itself on beverly elms fyi had lots of hidden things that had clearly not been checked by me at move in or the home shop i take responsibility as well such as the plumbing landscaping dishwasher pest control and carpet stay tuned even though im relieved of the stress and anxiety of dealing with this garbage property management im not done michele you earned all of the attention your e about to get shes even got bots submitting fake 5 star reviews how low is that that only happens when you dont have any happy customers to write real reviews|0

we visited the dealership recently looking for a new car and were pleasantly surprised to see they had a very diverse sale staff including a number of females a female rep approached and worked with us for an hour or more providing excellent service when it came time to talk pricing we sat at her cubicle and my partner pointed out how there were many offices full of male sales staff but that the females mostly were in cubicles i checked it out and noticed 3 cubicles occupied by women and then at least 4 offices with men i tried to ignore my feeling this wasnt right until it came time for our female rep to quote a price she said let me go chat with my manager suddenly a man comes out if no where and takes over the sale process he sits in her chair quotes the price instructs her to go photocopy the price sheet and then aggressively tries to close the sale little did he know the dealership lost the sale the second he took over the worse two parts were 1 when he started scolding her for not showing us a certain feature like a grumpy dad she asked us about the feature during the test drive and we expressly told her it didnt interest us and 2 when it became obvious we werent buying today suddenly he was pushing his card in our hand assuming that of course this would be more of interest to us than hers i asked for hers at this point and practically ran out of the store because i was so bothered i her way nissan get with the times this is 2016 put some of those female staff in the offices they deserve and drop the subtle but obvious to us sexist behaviour you are servicing an urban and progressive clientele that will notice these things even if you have no idea i get sexism is rampant in the auto industry but surely as the strong valued family dealership you describe yourself to be you can do better|0

we lived here from 20152017 and before they changed ownership to aura before rent was cheap for what you got now its a bit overpriced the typical issues to expect will be ac and water they run on a chiller system so you dont have control when the a cheater turns off on we had to buy a portable ac to make it bearable when theres no ac secondly they always shut off water without notice or they will give you notice on the day of so if you dont have water you dont have ac so thats bad too be cautious of your surroundings many people here steal things off your pouch and there have been several car break ins so be careful where you park and dont leave anything of value in your car the grounds are littered in animal poop and the playground used to be useable but people have burned and melted parts of it did i mention people let their dogs poop in the playground area and wont pick it up we told the office but not much they can do but note it down and send out letters to residents most problems we have experienced arent really the office management faults but the residents that live here the office does try to help and keep up but its hard to do when you have residents that dont care and keep up the place as well|0

warning this may be lengthy its just how i roll we have friends that have campers and we have discussed purchasing our own for about 710 years we have heard a lot about the various brands and dealerships and i am obsessive about researching our purchases and planning we were finally going to take the plunge and sell our first born son and buy a travel trailer woot we already upgraded in our thought process from a popup to hybrid trailer and at the last minute planted firmly on a fifth wheel ok not at last minute but rather after researching we found they were safer and easier to maneuver i scoured travel trailer forums reviews etc and we zero i in on 3 units 2 by keystone and 1 by grand design i found the units located at 3 different dealerships and visited 2 and called the last one since they were 15 hour drive paul events re country in mesa was our first stop and chris be ror one the sales guy tooled us around to look at the unit on my list and a few others i actually fell in love with a unit they had on sale but it was 4 over the max length my hubby was willing to pull chris answered all of our questions was very patient with us one test my husband does is to see how they respond to me my questioning typically they just try talking to him he soft pitches them to me chris quickly picked up on that after the est pitch took his clues from me after that i explained we were just starting our hunt had others to look at and probably would not be purchasing until end of year where we would pay cash he tried a couple of incentives but was not overly pushy which we appreciated he also asked what other units and advised that their store in flagstaff had the grand design unit we were going to look at he indicated they would work with us for any units at any of their locations we visited little dealer in mesa and looked at few grand design models and spoke with the sales guy he advised us of their lifetime warranty they include the prices of the units themselves was the same as at paul events and also at orangewood dealer we called we decided we would go ahead and purchase now and pay it off in a few months so i started negotiations with all 3 dealers at this point it was about price service customer service service department in the end chris and paul events came in with the best deal i also liked that paul events service manager has been with them for years i researched the dealerships and paul events had the best reviews as well overall now the true test was to see how the end result after negotiations ended we filled out financing application but i also applied with our credit union the deal with our cu was great they are local and so we decided to go with them however it can be a bit more difficult since it was a new unit so there were phone calls between the cu me and the dealership to get all of the paperwork the cu required the final straw that almost broke the camels back was getting the i can not recall what they call it but the certificate of ownership which is what the manufacturer provides to get it titled so it is the title and needless to say they were not wanting to send it to the cu for closing i spoke with ryan in financing at paul events and since he had to be at the cu branch for closing asked him to have his corporate office send the document to him and he can bring to the branch at closing at which time he gets the cashiers check he was able to get the corporate office to agree we included in the deal an auto slide hitch installation the unit we purchased has a pin box kingpin so it did not need the auto slide they opted to put in a different hitch this is the only complaint that i had throughout the whole process they did not call to explain about the change prior to us picking up our vehicle but in the end it was a good hitch and works great also it was 900 cheaper and they made good and gave us the refund even without all of this being in writing i was nervous about that and waited to write my review until everything was completed as they verbally stated chris was phenomenal he was quick to respond and even if he did not have the answer he let me know he was working on it i am in the customer service business in banking and i value good service i feel chris and his manager provided excellent service and the integrity with them following through on everything they stated throughout the process was priceless for us we have had our unit for a month now and love it we could not be happier with our choice of dealership and camper thanks chris|1

i contacted this office after a recommendation i submitted the quicky online form to get the ball rolling their website states that they handle all sorts of incidents including automobile accidents once on the phone with the clerk i was asked if i had sought medical treatment i replied no and that the only source of medical treatment i had available to me would take months to get an appointment at that point i was told that this office would not be able to help me i asked point blank if this office was just an injury attorney office which the clerk responded with a yes so if you were in an accident and had not been to seek medical or if you lost wages or if your vehicle damage lost value due to an accident dont call this office they only handle injury cases and apparently nothing else on a high note for this office they did contact me within hours of submitting the online form i had some hope even for a brief minute actually 5 or 6 minutes thats how long the conversation was with the clerk that vetted my request|0

i dont think that i can really take this place seriously i was in town for my friends birthday and we myself and two other guys decided to check out some different bars in charlotte to get away from uptown he had heard good things about this place and its concept and it appeared to be for the culture it kind of reminds me of one clubhouses that each of the university city student apartment complexes had back when i was in school here upon entering it seemed as though the group of people that were there were really enjoying themselves some sorority and fraternity types sipping and playing a couple of the games seemed fine enough we went to the bar where i was going to buy the first round the bar is rather small and there are no taps even though i feel like the website says that there are may be they were down that day who knows i didnt see signs of them the beer selection that was there wasnt very appeasing to me bud light miller meh give me a whiskey and ginger ale the bartender hands me little kids plastic water cup with ice a half shot of whiskey and ginger ale is this what people come for im here now so why not make the most of it i order just a straight hennessy neat and its another half shot in the bottom of said kids plastic water cup i ask her to double it up suh the sadness continues long story short i as well as my party were over it needless to say we headed towards uptown the space is large and interestingly arranged seating at the bar is for the regulars and bartenders friends the food didnt look appetizing enough although we were kind of hungry according to some other reviews we dodged a bullet on that to sum up this place its as someone else said this place has a lot of unrealized potential|0

i used to go to the place a lot before they became green clean like many of their customers i was assured the only change was in the name and that they would continue to use the same dry cleaning products recently though i noticed some of my polo shirts still stink like body odor after i picked them up i brought this to their attention and they re did the shirts for free no difference shirt still stunk the lady working the counter suggested i get them laundered instead so i did and even agreed to pay full price today i went in to pick up the shirts only to find that they had once again been dry cleaned and still reeked on top of that buttons on some button up shirts that they broke the time before when i brought them in and was told would be repaired i did not notice this until i got home so i did not bring it up at the location the lady working the counter around up on 12615 was very combative and rude when she told me in a very manner of fact tone that they dont launder polo shirts unless i signed a release form which the lady working the counter two weeks earlier never mentioned so she was really the final straw and the 50100 i spend per month on dry cleaning will be spend elsewhere likely at a place that knows what the word clean in dry cleaning means|0
warning stay away must be going out of business or has gone out of business i went into connelly billiards on may ith and met with one of their sales people to discuss purchasing a brand new pool table for my new place they were friendly and explained the process of needing 46 weeks to get the pool table set up in my house after picking out the table cloth and accessories which came out to approx 5000 they asked me to pay in full up front which was odd to me but sadly i agreed after 4 weeks and hearing nothing from them i called in and they told me everything was just fine and they were closer to the 6 week time frame again i should have questioned more but i did not another 2 weeks went by so now we were at the 6 weeks originally quoted and still no word call or email from connelly billiards so i tried calling the store this time no ring at all just straight to voicemail i left a message no call back and i tried 3 more times over a few days with the same outcome i drove over to the store to find a sign on the door stating they were out for a family emergency i called the manufacturer of the pool table directly to see if they could give me more info after they looked into it they shared they had been unable to reach connelly billiards as well over the past couple weeks the manufacturer also confirmed they never received an order on the table i paid them in full for i can only assume at this point they are going out of business and knowingly took my order and asked me to pay in full up front while never placing the order with the manufacturer and lying to me the entire time about how everything was on track and fine this is the most dishonest and highest form of theft i have ever experienced if they try to continue doing business please avoid i will also be reporting them to the state and better business bureau|0

beware can brian and his crew lay beautiful tile and hard wood yes no doubt but in the process you will wish you had opted for a better contractor because if its like my house your kitchen cabinets that were in perfect condition originally will be majorly damaged after brians response we cant we re posible for the damage our tools do when tearing up tile they didnt try to cover pad or offer any protection to minimize the potential for damage baseboards we thought we would reuse the originals which were in good condition brian supported this and brian quoted for tear down and replacement of the original baseboards ha brian put them back up like a damaged puzzle pieces were broken and glued back together edges in wrong spots i had to buy new baseboards and hire someone to repair them the toilet previously functioned correctly but after brian removed the toilet to re tile the bathroom he wasnt able to replace the toilet without a leak so he re removed and text me to buy a new toilet he scratched up my front door by scraping old tile and trash across the door as full hands passed through and while the floors look great he messed up the transitions not pretty ill have to pay 250 for new transitions and labor of another contractor to do it right this 3 day project spanned 3 weeks aside from 3 days of delay in supplies no fault to brian this project just drug on far far longer than needed and to make matters worse brian broke into my house after the work was complete i changed the house codes 123 as hed stated that day he would be complete work i dont keep contractor codes around any longer than needed for security saturday i noticed someone had been in my house he freely admits it was him but swears he used his code he didnt have authority to be there and i know he broke in through the back brian also multiple times during the project yelled belittled and called me names dont hire this guy check him out online first he lost his license previously it might happen again and he changes his biz name so no catches on quickly update 2016 brian agreed at the completion of service to take off ok for damages not nearly enough to cover what the damages cost but we met in the middle after signing the agreement that the final check less 1000 was paid in full he sued me for that money after reassessing the full cost of damages including the floor which is now coming up because he apparently forgot to use glue we counter sued tens of thousands in damages excluding legal fees the court case is ongoing his suit was dismissed by the court ours still pending i hope he loses his contractors license again and cant ever mess someones home up like ours is|0

if you are either in or near the riverton casino this is a great dining option you order at a counter and wait if you happen to be there during a casino wushu dining giveaway you will wait a long time many times over an hour but if not its worth the wait all food is made to order pan roasted wok fried make sure you check the small board near the register for the daily special these are hidden gems service is always with a smile even during the long wait periods especially good are the sauces perfectly paired with options like the potstickers or pork buns they will also customize your order based on spice preference also a nice touch is asking about food allergies peanuts before even finalizing an order|1

home depot is a convenient big box supplier my experience is that the associates are almost always friendly and not imposing they dont aggressively invite themselves into ones shopping but often ask if they can be of help sometimes they offer insights and explain differences in ways of tackling a project sometimes they will indicate they arent familiar with some expertise and offer a name to call back the next day at the store this is 375 star service for a home supply store the selection is usually good prices tend to be high but if you look for the post peak season discounts you get a decent deal i have not used any contractors or delivery service this particular location seems well kept weve bought a handful of potted plants which seemed to weather their season well enough|1

i had a very negative experience at this shoe store when i arrived two men just inside the door were arguing heatedly at that point it was unclear that they were affiliated with the store i tried on three pairs of shoes over a period of about fifteen minutes at which point one of the men who had been arguing approached me to say that i needed to go home and think about which shoes i wanted and that the salesperson would not bring me another pair of shoes his tone and body language were menacing and his comments were confusing as i had made a decision and was poised to buy a particular pair of shoes it was also unclear how he was affiliated with the store was he the manager the owner he refused to tell me his name he seemed agitated i felt quite badly for the salesperson who was caught in the middle of the situation the salesperson was nice frankly this experience was very upsetting may be i walked into an already charged situation ie the arguing that i heard at the outset i certainly hope that such events arent a regular occurrence is im editing this a day later to add that if your e looking for converse as i was then boutique xo inc on saint denis is wonderful in terms of their selection prices and lovely shopkeepers i went there this afternoon and found what i needed not getting thrown out of the store by a hostile person was definitely a plus|0

on saturday december with between approximately 630pm and around 800pm my wife and i were dining at with and ivy with another couple to celebrate an important event in our lives as a group we ordered a couple drinks some burgers the prime rib and the ravioli quite honestly by the end of the dinner no one in our party recalled how the food tasted and actually a couple of us simply did not eat after being seated our waitress was immediately very inappropriate and overly friendly with myself in particular despite it being very clear that i was with my wife as a matter of fact she did not even acknowledge my wife when she spoke to her rather she only focused on me feeling very uneasy already my wife and i switched chairs expecting that may be this would resolve the unusual interaction it did not when the waitress came over to take our orders she proceeded to walk right behind me and caress stroke my back from shoulder to shoulder right in front of my wife and our guests we were absolutely horrified and shocked what made it worse is she did not even consider her actions to be disrespectful to my wife or myself despite being appalled we still ordered our food because we were intent on having a good night out and did not want to cause a scene with our friends there as noted above my wife did not even eat and myself and one other guest barely finished our meals i honestly can not provide an assessment of the quality of food my apologies it got worse upon concluding the meal and having our plates taken away the same waitress came back and once again stroked my back and shoulders this was not a simple light touch this was an intentional rub of my shoulders i moved away from her in disgust and looked at her like she must have been insane and my wife demanded to just receive the bill my wife asked her what her name was and the waitress replied that it was i and why and raised her voice and asked what it was she was doing wrong strangely if a similar action had taken place with a female guest or a similar event had occurred in an office in downtown calgary i do not expect anyone would have been wondering what it was she was doing wrong we told her what she was doing wrong clearly offered no tip but paid our full bill nevertheless upon conclusion of the transaction she looked at the receipt which was around 140 threw it on the table and she proceeded to walk away and talk about us with her other staff members and an individual who appeared to be the manager at this point no one else came over to discuss our concerns we left and pleasantly enjoyed a coffee with our friends at a different establishment we will not be returning to this restaurant or any other establishment operated by its parent company and certainly will not be recommending it to our friends family and coworkers|0
this place is amazing it is a smaller massage therapy clinic so it has a nice friendly home y feel to it i am able to get an appointment on fairly short notice all of the staff are amazing and friendly my favourite rat there is alicia she listens to what you say and her music selection is awesome think indie chill stuff not nature sounds the bill green shield directly which is fabulous it can be a bit tricky finding parking though|1
disappointing we arrived around 515pm on a sunday night the restaurant was not even half full being our first time at this restaurant we had to ask for help do we just sit at a table do we order at the counter can someone help us we decided to order a whole pizza while we waited we read their menu and found they buy fresh local ingredients nice after our first few bites we realized the pepperoni was missing we took our pizza up to the counter the manager apologized and took our pizza when he came back to our table about 10 minutes later he brought our original pizza back basically all he did was add pepperoni and a little more cheese and popped it into the oven for a bit really overall not a good experience dirty table empty silverware containers and about half of the fountain soda flavors were out of order the food was pretty cheap though about 15 for 12 pizza breadsticks and 2 sodas good option for college kids|0

had yum cha a few times at this place because its close by but honestly there are many better options out there this place is in an old run down plaza hidden in a small street so its not easy to spot for 260 and 290 on a weekend holiday dim sum quality is cheap and food is oily and messy definitely not worth the price as its on the higher end plates are dirty and service is quite slow usually you dont have to wait for seating though because the place is quite big and not many people come here do not recommend unless you just want a quick dim sum fix|0

i called for directions and a very nice person answered and provided me with them but when i came into the store he was busy with a customer and another individual attempted to serve me i was going to have them pack and send a package but his style of communication was extremely negative we dont let the customers see how we pack he said the box is big because thats the way we do it it needs 3 inches around and more he would have been better off explaining company policy from the start and ask me if thats ok most likely i would say sure but he made every step a problem so i walked out and to the fed ex down the street i had a much better experience with fed ex|0

good food and the owner is an even better guy we enjoyed our dinner here ate here when tacos and beer was closed glad this was the case as we discovered quite a gem there were few people in the restaurant we came near closing but everyone was happy and welcoming favorites were the chili basil chicken and the lamb kabobs owner came out to greet us and recommended a few dishes they were great also even the chef came out to say hi really impressed with the service and the food was tasty and unique will definitely return|1
this place has been around for years and has been my go to late night shawarma place great portions and service the chick is amazing always juicy and crunchy at the same time only downside is they only take cash but luckily there is an atm inside highly recommend|1
not too happy about my stay here i will start out by saying the front lobby is newly renovated and has a very modern look to it many seats free computers and wifi fireplace lots of flat screen tis juice bar snack bar and lots of benches couches to relax on i arrived at the hotel around 930 and found myself behind a line of people with only 1 person behind the counter add to that the fact that one lady had no idea how canadian money worked and had to be instructed by the clerk it took me 20 minutes to check in not too fun after driving 8 hours to stand in line for 20 minutes when there was an extra employee and terminal available they needed my credit card for incidentals which is fine but what isnt fine is that they charged me 10175 immediately to the card they dont even wait to see if there is going to be a need for it i was not pleased about this since i was on a tight budget to begin with and this was an expense i had not factored once i finally got squared away and into the room everything calmed down for the most part i took a shower and noticed my footprints were turning black basically meaning the bathroom floor was real dirty a shame since the room itself appeared clean there was a wedding party on our floor and since the room was next to the elevator every few minutes we had to deal with the drunken laughter of everyone not the hotels fault really i just feel like mentioning it here the next day we spent in the city and upon returning i discovered something that troubled me my toothbrush was missing my electric toothbrush that is impossible to misplace was gone the only ones to enter the room was housekeeping during the day i am ocd enough that i keep everything together and the brush was no longer there thinking my friend might have misplaced it we turned the room upside down looking for it it could not be found anywhere we went to complain to the front desk and got the answer of they just returned jewelry why would they steal a toothbrush you tell me skeeter they offered me another one but it was insulting that they didnt even bother looking to see who worked my floor that day to even question them at all we went back to the room and made a call to the local drug store asking if they carried it and was informed they didnt so ill just need to pick one up back home come to find out later that they charged me 175 for that 20 second local call feeling a little disgusted my friend went downstairs to order a chai tea and they informed her that for anything extra she wanted would be charged an additional doc always something to get money so in summary come here if you need a bed to sleep in with free wireless internet access do not come here looking for clean floors good attitudes dependable staff and a willingness to serve the customer im going to wait till wednesday and if the 10175 isnt off my credit card by that point i am going to dispute it with my credit company and im not going to be staying here again 1 star for the bed and 1 star for the wireless|0
i had a horrible first experience with molly maid specifically with franchise owner named marla miller im not one to write about and call out people and rant off about small ridiculous things but this was honestly a huge time wasting and disappointing experience i am just moving downtown toronto furniture has not been moved into my condo unit yet i came across molly maid online unfortunately i decided to request a quote online and they gave me a call back they confirmed that it would be 135hour and that they estimate my condo to take 125 hours very precise and interesting number but ok i accepted and they sent me a confirmation email along with getting my credit card on file in case of a last minute cancellation looking through the confirmation message they mention that i need to accommodate for their parking spot otherwise my credit card would be charged for public parking and that there will be a sign off once the cleaning is complete to guarantee 100 satisfaction however you can coordinate an alternate time for the sign off if the time does not work for you they said that they would arrive between 830900 am and told me to be there for 930 for the sign off but wait thats not 125 hours if they are starting somewhere in between 830 and 900 and im signing off at 930 i kindly responded back to the confirmation email that i dont have a parking spot available and that i would pay for their public parking after my request of signing off at a different time outside of my work hours marla responds the morning of at 930 which was the time of sign off saying sorry i have been organizing the teams and i didnt get this in time but nothing related to scheduling our sign off time i left work to check on the condo about a 15 minute walk and the cleaners had not began yet and it was a little after 930 now they began the clean and i received another email from marla pretty much saying that the sign off must happen right after the clean if it is not then i will not guarantee the clean this is extremely poor service as i never confirmed after reading the confirmation email and i was following the guidelines which said that we could arrange an alternate sign off time i had to get back to work and let the cleaners do their job as they would be returning the key to the concierge i get notified 20 minutes later that the key has been returned to the front desk and receive a different email saying you did not sign for the key with the concierge that held up the team all the best and i need to go now very sorry i was very confused as i was there and allowed the cleaners upstairs about 1 hour after their starting time confirmed that i was there i did sign for the key and that the cleaners were the ones who arrived late marla emails me back saying do rsa for your clean today the clean has ended and there will be no charge for it all best essentially cancelling the cleaning about 12 hours after the scheduled starting time after ive left work to check on the place and arranged my morning to get this job done before my furniture move in i returned back to my condo after work and nothing was touched except for some reason they had put some of my boxes in the middle of the entrance on the floor which makes me question what they were doing for 20 minutes in the unit all in all i had a very bad experience and will never be using molly maid or suggesting anyone to work with them i expressed that i am disgusted with this service and that i will definitely leave a horrible review and she did not deal with the situation professionally and she completely wasted my time her response was no reason for a review as you are not a customer of molly maid downtown toronto as you did not pay as well the email that you sent was unacceptable as there is only pink and blue here and that kind of talk will not be accepted is someone tripping out here anyways not sure what i did but i definitely know what they didnt do anything right|0
we took out a basic meal from this restaurant only to discover a partly opened staple yes from a desk stapler in the pad thai fortunately there was no injury however the staple was opened and was essentially equivalent of finding a fish hook in our food after speaking with the restaurant we were informed the owner manager is only in on tuesday we requested to speak with the manager and waited but received no followup call we were initially offered a free entree however we felt important the manager understood the significance of this problem and made changes to avoid something like this happening in the future however because the manager did not follow up were leaving this review so i can inform any new user of this restaurant that something similar might happen to them and to be careful a staple is made of metal and easily lodged in the esophagus in this case i can not understand how staple managed to find its way into it closed container of pad thai suffice to say if i was the manager i would be alarmed and following up immediately owner manager needs to address customer complaints and take measures to avoid contaminating food this case it resulted in a negative review however theyre lucky it could have been a lawsuit|0
my husband and i come here every other tuesday for a movie happy hour and we are normally over impressed with the service and value last time we ordered popcorn and drink in the theater we waited and waited then found our waitress standing outside our movie movie on her phone oh did you want your popcorn duh do i need to get it myself tonight my 6 oz wine pour was 4 oz and the road trip for 2 was more like a road trip for 1 and we waited 45 minutes whats up|0

i went to the centre street location to get 2 phones repaired 1 i phone 5 needed a new screen 1 i phone 4 needed a new front and back when they were done neither phone worked i went back across town and waited for them to repair the phones again when they were done i left everything appeared to be fine the i phone 5 worked however the back on the i phone 4 fell as i was using it i the went back a third time to have them repair the phone by this time i was quite upset the man who worked on the phone said there were no screws in the phone so he didnt secure it he says he did this time and simply shrugged when asked if there was anything he would do to compensate for lost time he simply mumbled and shrugged his shoulders i have sent referrals to this shop before but i wont next time ill go to another business if youve seen their countless ads on kijiji do yourself a favour and stay far away|0
we reserved a van and received a call the day before stating no vans were available and a nissan pathfinder replaced it for no extra charge i was disappointed because we would be crowded for out drive to chicago 2 adults and 4 kids but we would manage there was also limited cargo room upon picking the suv up kyle assured me he would take care of me i saw the paperwork and i was told not to worry about returning it with a full tank of gas for my inconvenience well the car was filthy dirty with stains on the seats sterling wheel sticky and crumbs there was even a game left in the back kyle again apologized and said he would talk to his service people as i am driving home i couldnt get over the smell the smoke smell that is on my paperwork kyle wrote no smoking apparently the people before didnt get that memo hertz should invest in some fe breeze once we returned the car but husband talked to katie explained our story and she basically turned a deaf ear very disappointing young kids running the show with terrible customer service shame on you hertz|0
i actually like heidi deli its in the corner so some time it may be hard to spot but their breakfast sandwiches are pretty good i always stop by there for breakfast whenever i can its just sometimes the line gets long and its a bit discouraging its not part of one of those franchise chain so it doesnt have all those fancy pictures and lighting displays but i think i like it better the hipster in me gets satisfied from may visits to heidi deli overall i recommend this place after a while you realize these small businesses serves up food that are a lot better than those huge franchise stores|1

wow so far im very pleased going through a complete renovation in july 2017 4 months ago i was looking for good quality carpeting at a great price when i walked into truly carpets i was a bit overwhelmed by all the carpet rolls but when i told dennis what i was looking for he told me about new stock coming in it was the perfect color texture a great brand and there was enough for both rooms yippee i really wish id had truly carpet install all my flooring unfortunately i mistook discount as kind of shady subpar or subcontracted shame on me i didnt bother to ask them if they subcontract their installs my loss hindsight now wish id had them floor my entire home truly installed a marvelous high end carpet remnants in my 2 bedrooms but stupidly i went with loves for the ergo the install ugh loves what a huge nightmare i should have asked truly to find me stock because they had much better quality comm is loves umm ergo stock truly installers arrived and did an amazing job the biggest blessing is that the installers are part of the family rather than subcontracted out as loves does nightmare the project manager was so knowledgeable teaching me what i should have known before id gone shopping my home flooring is gorgeous when its time to resurface my floors ill be going back to truly carpet flooring|1

harry is about what you would expect it to be they serve burgers steaks etc just do not expect your steak to be cooked correctly none of these suburban steakhouses can cook a steak properly especially if you are in a large group the restaurant was clean and dimly lit i was okay with the place until i stopped in the restroom on the way out any restaurant with a bathroom this dirty and run down can not be trusted i was going to give three stars but the manager working this afternoon just did not seem to care and he seemed rude it must be safer to eat at a chain steakhouse than at harry|0

thank you tesla for always picking great spots to have superchargers since getting my tesla back in december ive visited this place about once every week or so and its always been so convenient it is located and town square with all sorts of restaurants and shops where you can run your errands at while you wait for your car to charge theres a whole foods for groceries a few nice restaurants like texas de brazil and flemings and plenty of clothing retailers i also really appreciate that its in the corner of the parking lot and easy to find some other chargers are hidden away but thankfully tesla did right by putting it at the corner near and visible to the intersection|1
we paid a year in advance after 12 months we received a late notice along with a 10 late charge instead of a bill i called to find out why no bill and was informed they do not send bills but they do send late notices asked to have the 10 late charge waived and the manager refused common courtesy and a good business practice would have been a simple email or phone call to remind us of the renewal the part that really made no sense was the willingness to waive the 10 late fee if we went on monthly autopsy my intention was to pay for another year but instead she was insistent on making that extra 10 this is a huge customer service fail on this facility and will probably result in us moving our stuff as we only use the locker to store files with no monetary value there was also a break in to multiple units a few months ago we were fortunate as there would be no interest in the files we store however multiple lockers were entered i am not sure if the others were so lucky be careful what you store at this facility this company should take the opportunity to learn from this customer service failure as a year in advance worth of rent was lost for 10 and you now have a very dissatisfied customer|0
i did a carry out pick up order tonight i had the three piece dark chicken sweet potato with marshmallows and brown sugar and their apple it is a 20 minute ride home and the food was still hot the lady that waited on me was very friendly antonio na was her name when she talked it was hard to understand what she was saying it sounded like she had her greeting memorized and her words ran together but like i said she was friendly and the food was delicious boston market has most of the time had excellent food|1
i bought a used hot tub from them it was delivered and i was told to contact them when i had the electric hook up complete and they would come and show me how to use it i called when i had electric and the next day i come home and its full of water the cover is off its running and my garden hose is disconnected from the house cut into 6 pieces and laying all over my yard i called and left a message for them the only response i got is that they were trying to do something nice for me but my hose had a leak ummm so they cut it all up the used tub came with a 90 day warranty on the mechanical parts around day 60 i realized that when the jets kicked on the heat turns off i contacted them to ask about it and they told me it was supposed to work that way so after talking to some people i called another company to come out and take a look and that is not how it was to operate it cost 1000 to replace the part and get it working correctly of course outside of the 90 day window do not buy anything from them unless you really know what your e doing and dont let them help you out|0

i cut a my nerve in my finger and had it operated on and it never healed after my physical therapy ended i was in so much pain so i looked for alternative treatments i called this place and saw they offer some electric stem treatment i said how is it different from my physical therapy electric stem they said we use these cups and its more power when your in pain you will try anything i drive over an hour several times a week for months to get this treatment after so many treatments it didnt work so i stopped going its basically an electric stem i was getting in physical therapy no different you can also buy them at cos i recently received a call i owe a very large amount of money i said but before i started coming you said my insurance covered it and i payed 2500 copy plus additional 1500 on top of that i said why didnt you tell me ive been coming for 5 months she said they did cover it 200 of it be cautious they lie and tell you your covered up front then they wait wait until you stop going to bill you so you never know you will get huge bills in the mail insurance companies dont cover there electric stem treatment or any of the do visits dont take advantage of people because eventually youll get caught especially people in pain who are not working because of an injury|0

let me start with the good stuff the website is clean and sleek the payment online is a breeze and they are open on saturdays what makes me rate them so low they advertise on their web site that they do price match but in fact they do not here is what happened i purchased some 3 cut boxes 18 i 18 i 16 for 3 each on may way to pick them up i stopped at one of the big box home improvement to stores name starts with i for something else and i see exactly the same sized box for 167 i purchased one just to make sure i am comparing apples with apples i popped at the store and i told them about the huge price difference showed them the box which is exactly the same as theirs and asked about the possibility of a price match the answer was clear no with the explanation that they could not do price match with big box stores with all my respect for the small family businesses i believe the price match or the lack of needs to be properly advertised the guys could clearly make me happier if they at least offered to give a small discount at this point my dissatisfaction is not about the money i have overpaid much more for much bigger purchases but the honesty factor could and should be better when your are a small shop just my 2 cents no offence i tried to stick to the facts|0

no desire to go back to this place the man behind the counter was rude and impatient he asked me what i wanted and when i said i was looking he told me i interrupted his lunch and would have locked the door if he wasnt waiting for me making me felt rushed and kinda bad for interupting his lunch at 530 am may be the open sign and open door led me to believe he was on duty but i guess his lunch was more important than a customer i will not return and with that kind of attitude i hope no one else does either this kind of customer treatment warrants the business closing being in customer service and sales i would be fired immediately for that behavior worst part is i think he was owner meaning that this behavior wont be corrected may be losing customers will show him his behavior is not becoming of a person in customer service|0
my daughter got her i phone 5 fixed at the kiosk in arrowhead mall and a week or so later the screen started to come up on the top and left side when going to get it fixed the guy said it was a battery problem when there had been no battery problem what so ever before hand tried putting on the screen and said it was already not working continued to put on a new screen in which after had a black spot and he said it was due to the battery and didnt do anything about it customer service was sub par and was not at all satisfied with my experience and which i couldve been refunded would not recommend|0

the burger industry is a competitive one especially in this town but this place has great burgers which i would compare to in i out they also have a kids menu and other items to choose from if burgers arent your thing only issue is that the location is small so finding a seat can be tricky on a busy evening and its never fun to get your tray of food and have no place to sit enjoyed my first visit and will return|1

i lived there for 3 years so i have seen a lot it started out as an okay place to live but has gone quite downhill since there are cops here at least once a month including one time because an infant was kidnapped and there have been quite a few car burglaries that have happened that the office never told anyone about but thankfully the neighbors let people know maintenance is pretty good about coming when needed and they are super nice the front office is nice too and are good about getting maintenance to come when needed the apartments have the thinnest walls ive ever seen so thin that you can hear the upstairs neighbor flush the toilet the outside grounds typically have trash and dog poop everywhere and most apartments seem to have a roach problem definitely not the worst place for how much they charge in rent but if you can afford more i would look for better|0

this complex used to be amazing but the manager who has taken over the last 6 months has really let this place go to shit pictured here is a nasty area growing green sludge on a major walkway into one of the buildings it hasnt been cleaned in several months they replace light bulbs that are out in the hallways with bright white light bulbs that dont match the pale yellow ones that are everywhere else i mean really just use the same light bulbs it isnt hard or replace all of them to be the same there has been a ceiling fan broken in the gym for several months that hasnt been fixed and broken gym equipment that they havent fixed the yoga mats are disgusting torn up and so dirty you feel like youll get an infection just from touching them the carpets in the hallways havent been cleaned in a very long time either add to that they recently did an inspection on all of the air filters and smoke detectors in the apartments the person who inspected ours noticed that one of ours was missing batteries and its been over a month and still hasnt been fixed the people currently managing this complex try to be as cheap as possible and cant even do the bare minimum to keep things buttoned up it used to be one of the nicest places ive ever lived now im sad to even give it one star also need to add that they dont have cameras anywhere to stop people from breaking into cars and stealing bikes from the bike cages if you call their courtesy patrol they say theyll write it down and call the apartments in the morning to tell them about it but dont actually secure anything or try to fix it hire some security|0
i was moving and needed a unit last minute and anchor storage had one ready for me very shortly after i called very friendly people that work there and its a great facility and location when i no longer needed my unit anymore the process was very easy as well highly recommend this storage facility great prices too|1
kathy i is not filthy the decor is a little off putting but best described as good old fashion hole in the wall the food is great freshly cooked after you order thus the reason for the wait which can seem like an eternity when you are hungry i wish they would serve some complimentary cornbread or some type homemade bread to nibble on while you wait it is cheap and could help with patience while you are waiting might help with customer service fried chichen is great greens oxtail i pork chops you name it we have had it and it was all good the peach cobbler was just like grandmas i almost cried a little pricey but it is very good pay in cash their pay system is weird and you get charged 350 for using your debit no warning about it either so take cash|1
we hired light feld to do some plumbing work as part of a remodel of a small master bathroom in all they had four tasks to complete 1 install shut off valves for the bathroom sink 2 install the shower handle and valve 3 install shower head and 4 install shower base and attach the drain when we used the shower after this we found the shower head leaking badly and the handle would only turn on half way and not get fully hot they came back out and tightened the shower head denting it and it turned out that they installed the valve backwards which should have been a very easy and common install when we started using the shower again a few days later we found that water was leaking into our basement the remodeled bathroom is on the second floor so the water had leaked from the shower base drain into our kitchen ceiling to the outer wall where it followed an air vent down to the basement this was evidenced by paint bubbling at the drywall seams in the kitchen ceiling we then had light feld out again showed them the water in the basement and the kitchen ceiling then left them to fix the leak after they finished they said they got another half turn on the drain and added some silicone they also expressed that what they did should fix the problem keeping a close eye on the basement we resumed using the shower and it hasnt leaked since light feld initially said that they would take care of repairing the damage we had an independent contractor come out who agreed with our assessment and gave us an estimate for the work light feld then sent their own person who ended up being an old friend of melanie light feld that was apparently sent to discredit us and give us unsolicited legal advice it turned out that light feld had since decided that they didnt want to pay anything so they came back to us saying they didnt think they were responsible for the damage needless to say we were disappointed with this lack of integrity and professionalism we could have understood screwing up three of the four tasks we hired them for if they would have been accountable for those mistakes but they ultimately decided that their character had a price limit we wouldnt recommend light feld to anyone looking for a plumber there are plenty of other companies who will likely do a much better job and know that screwing over your customers just isnt good business lastly besides the work being terrible their customer service was even worse in 15 years of home ownership we have never had such an awful experience with a company|0
a mixed bag at best ordered on new years eve a family tradition is chinese food on nye telephone ordering was pleasant and had no problems easy pickup the food however well the quality of the ingredients was very good with tender meat and a reasonable amount of it the only item that was poor in quality were the chicken balls which were among the worse ive ever had in terms of texture filler and meat but everything else was just tasteless i normally order szechuan peppered and curried items from chinese restaurants wings were just bland bland and more bland even the leftovers which usually have their flavours settle a bit were flavour less overall a shame because i have to continue to search for a good place here in the northwest we can get reasonable vietnamese just about everywhere but chinese food seems to be really hard to find and wings sure didnt end my search|0

skip the big fast casual chains in the east end and hit up az or e an for lunch its also fast also casual and chances are youll get a much more fresh house made and delicious meal for the same or less money service was very friendly and the portion sizes were generous i had the tuna salad which was phenomenal but everything on the menu sounded delicious definitely check it out street parking along liberty and the side streets usually isnt too bad at all either|1
the employees that work here should not work here because they are not friendly they are mean make sighing noises when you are getting your items out of the cart or if you are taking 5 seconds to look for a coupon mind you that when i went there was nobody behind me so i could take my time there items are not label correctly and when you want that price it was labeled for they dont give to you and when you ask to be contracted by the manger they dont even follow up this is a place with bad management bad employees with a sucky attitude close it down|0

have been to this store several times in the last few months since i live in the area every single time i have gone there they have not had what i needed always chalking it up to oh we get so busy that we sell out right away but we can order what you need well guess what so can i every person that ive come across that has mentioned this store has always said the same thing as me how do they stay in business these are basic supplies that are essential to keeping a cake supply store open ive been to the store several times and the store has been closed with a sign that says be back in 15 minutes however went by this weekend a couple times only to find the store tarp ed up with a sign that says excuse our mess and the doors are locked ive tried calling the business number to see if they plan to reopen only to find that the number has been disconnected as well as their facebook page has disappeared sure would be nice to have notice as to what is going on closed temporarily closed im not surprised poorly ran business|0
this is the first time ever i have a pedicure and i decided to give cha us a try everything was great the staffs were all very friendly brian was my nail technician i always imagine my nail technician will be a young lady but funny how throughout my life so far i went to nail salon two times i always have male giving me the service but i really enjoyed it both times and give very much respect brian was very sweet gentle and funny i went by myself so he was actively chatting with me this was my first time doing a pedicure like i said so i cant really give any comparison but i felt very relax and satisfied with the result i cant stop looking at my fee et so clean and soft environment was okay nothing fancy but suitable for the price im paying i like how they didnt try to up sell me anything additional service at all didnt feel any pressure left as a happy customer|1
great food friendly staff great service impressed with their ability to resolve customer complaints in a prompt and professional manner will be a repeat customer|1
i have to agree with another poster on here they are hardly ever stocked with the basic daily life essentials milk vegetables eggs meat etc things seem to have improved a little but still they are very under stocked i have talked to management before and they always have an excuse like we werent expecting this to be such a high production store we changed providers so were waiting on them to bring the stock well theyve been open for a year now and they know its a very high production store so they need to be better prepared used to shop at bilo across the road but walmart prices are definitely better it does get annoying to go shopping at walmart then still have to make a trip to bilo to get all of the stuff walmart didnt have may have to switch back to bilo altogether if walmart still cant get their act together|0

do not get wellness plans they are heartless in their billing i wish i could award negative stars i had to put our family pet dog down due to many incidents of severe panic biting at the time i asked and pleaded many times to make sure that everything was stopped and cancelled to save my wife the repeated trauma of the memories the dog was adopted by my youngest son who passed away 4 years ago they assured me at the store they would cancel the wellness plan and not send any emails regular mail or phone calls i had no problem paying the fees and charges for the sad but necessary procedure 3 months later i find out they are still billing us for a dead pet when i call to resolve this they insist on talking to my wife that is the one thing i tried to avoid its like they want to rub her nose in our dead sons dead dogs memory this is not even close to acceptable i find out now that there are 2 more bills scheduled to come out before the plans original term is done so the first question is is it worth 250 to try not to reopen my wifes grief and second will they call us to renew the plan they seem cold enough to do just that|0
ive been going here for years and love the way they do my nails they last longer than any other salon that i go to are very reasonable and sandy is always pleasant efficient and quick she gives you a quality product in a short time so im not wasting my entire day off getting my nails done this is not a place i would go for a relaxing spa day experience but it is what it is great results in a timely manner if your e looking for an aesthetically pleasant uppity spa this isnt the place for you but if your e looking for a great place to get your nails done for a reasonable price then youve found your place off to get my nails done|1
walked in at noon on a sunday when it opened i was told it would take about ten minutes for the broth for the pho to be ready ten minutes later i was told another 15 minutes we didnt get our food until 1240 its in the food court and they need to have it ready when it opens most other food court places open at am the chicken in the pho tasted like frozen microwave chicken pieces the broth tasted fine the herb bags had more stems and less herbs missing the thai basil|0

this tim horton location is tucked away behind a bunch of other restaurants and hotel its a smaller restaurant with small numbers of seating you would think because of the hotel next door that you clean up a bit nope it was dirty with food crumbs all over the floor tables were not wiped clean for hours the selection of donuts and tim bits were less than sparse however this location was also the first time i had ever seen a venetian cream filled tim bit overall dont have expectations here as its dirty and filthy|0
this place is an italian restaurant with an identity crisis they have a sign with gourmet pizza on it but we have been there twice now and they say they dont have any pizzas secondly they give you a menu and they tell you that we are doing specials and both times the menu has been the same so not sure where are the specials when asked why there is no pizza the response is the chef is trying something new with persian and spanish food so my response to that is they should try something new and change their restaurant name and remove gourmet pizza if they are i it serving pizza to add to it all the restaurant stinks of smoke and it is always empty i wouldnt recommend this place at all|0

i am an arizona native that is currently displaced in another state i am very familiar with southwestern jewelry and the like i had been an avid fan of gilbert omega but have had to rethink my position i would say that the last three times i have gone to either one of their stores in old town scottsdale have left me feeling like my business is not wanted several years ago i purchased a watch from them out of their old pawn section i have loved this watch and wore it every day there did come a time that i needed to have some repair work done on it and so i took it back to gilbert omega to have the work done the reason i took it there was because i figured that they would be the best qualified since they deal with this type of jewelry on a regular basis i trusted them to know what they were doing i believe the gentleman i dealt with was is the current owner but i am not certain anyway he was very rude and condescending he rudely stated that they do not do warranty work and that i would have to pay for any services taken a back by his attitude i explained that i fully expected to pay for the repairs and that i brought it to them because this is where i bought it and trusted they would be able to fix it properly boy was i ever wrong they did the repair and sent me my watch back but they damaged it badly there was a crack across the band and they soldered a plate to reinforce it but they used lead solder on silver my watch is now disintegrating because lead eats away the silver over time there is no way to fix what they did they also broke one of the turquoise stones because they did not remove them when they soldered it i just found this out when i took it to another silversmith in north scottsdale they showed me all the damage that was done needless to say i had to replace my watch i will never shop at gilbert omega ever again and i will definitely warn everyone i talk to that they should steer clear of them|0
worst customer service ever two days ago we needed some fast food before jumping on the plane to calgary the plane was leaving in 15 minutes so i gave my son my credit card to order us two plates of pad thai noodles because we were in a rush and starving hadnt eaten in six hours and who wants to eat airplane food usually when you order noodles from thai express their food is already cooked and they to scoop it out for you and that way its quick however here they charge my sons credit card handed it back to him and then said come back in 20 minutes how many people wait 20 minutes for fast food thai noodles especially at an airport where people are about to jump on a plane i had to wait by our luggage to make sure all our stuff wasnt stolen so thats why i had given my 14 year old my credit card so after this snafu i needed to leave my luggage go back to the thai place ask for a refund and they treat us like we are complete idiots and chastise my son and said she told him it would take 20 minutes however she didnt tell him that until after he had paid what a pain in the ass make your food faster|0

please watch for incorrect pricing non abi dance with posted sale signs and charging higher than shelf prices first instance a sale sign for a dairy products which they rudely refused to honour because their sign should have been taken down since it had expired sloppy second event was when i pointed out that certain baked goods had gone well over the manufacturers sell by date next day i was shocked because kitchen table removed the product dates tonight a tin of nice looking cookies yum i thought at the till they scanned at higher than posted price and the store refused to abide by the independent grocers also policy of item free up to 1000 this store appears to have their own way of not protecting their customers pockets no more loyalty there from me|0
2 stars because it takes some skill to be so perfectly mediocre i went for dinner at the smith and all 4 of us were not too impressed by our meals they werent awful but we were disappointed in how meh they were we went there to celebrate a birthday and ended up feeling bad that this person was being celebrated with such a dismal meal the menu is laughable with multiple spelling errors and the pizza listed with appetizers feels like a red flag when even the paper menu is not done well staff are friendly enough but all in all i wouldnt come back|0

well what can i say the owners are very nice and try i think the wife should do more then seat people she could pass food around while the husband cooks diff meats they use like four of the same meats but say their different for example adding garlic sauce on it counts as one wine comes with the group on however if you dont want it you only get one soda i started feeling sick before i left and believe i have food poi sing ive been gone less then 25 mins and been in the bathroom three times already the meats are cooked on the grill not like texas de brazil when they have all the meats cooking on a rotational cooker i would try it spend they extra 10 and go to texas de brazil i wanted to like this place i did oops back to bathroom|0
i had two tubs worked on the first one had chips and rust when they finished it looked brand new i did opt for the non skid bottom and it is like sand under your feet its fine for standing but not comfortable to sit on it was recommended since we normally use a bath mat which would void the warranty now that its done i wish i hadnt had them add it the second tub had tiny stress cracks from wear that did not affect the structure of the tub but it looked bad it looks good now the bottom of the tub was rough and scratched me at first but they came back out to sand down the sharp bits and buff it out overall im happy with the repairs and i must stress the price was much lower than the other three quotes i got|1

i will not go back into this nail shop i used to live in the surprise area and had a couple of great experiences at dream nails they were friendly prompt and did an awesome job at nails so i decided to keep going there when i moved back to peril although i do believe that the service has gone downhill since i first went there every time i walk in there now i sit there unacknowledged last time i was sitting waiting for my pedicure for an hour i would have walked out but i was soaking and did not want to walk out with wet feet this time i was sitting there for almost 15 minutes and not one person said hello or well be right with you i understand they get busy on the weekends but customer service should be key this bad nail experience is not worth my time since there are plenty of other good nail shops in the area very disappointed in dream nails|0

i update my review of parkland commons to zero stars i have to click on one star to post this review but believe me the place is now a big fat zero this new management apogee i believe they are is downright slack and incompetent if my episode with the screen patio door wasnt bad enough now i am walking on wet carpet since wednesday evening i come home to find my carpet soaked near my ac unit i lucked out i left message on emergency maintenance line bow the message on that line still had the the complex doesnt have power spiel from last months power outage a maintenance person came by and fixed the problem but informed me it would be friday or monday before someone could come to dry out wet carpet really why should it take two days or more to have someone come dry my carpet to add fat to the fire of disorganization this maintenance rep said she was unable to enter my apartment earlier that day i had already placed work order about ac that morning because she didnt have a key the maintenance manager had quit smart guy to get off this incompetent ship and no one knew where the keys were he may have kept them in a shed lordy lord spare keys to residents apartments are floating out there in the universe wif arent these keys in the managers office anyway maintenance should sign out key when doing work order and sign it back in at managers office when work order completed of course i try to call office while at work friday but get placed on hold you never get a live person its always a recording that places you on hold twice i left a message with assistant manager inquiring about when carpet would be dried out and of course received no reply this is unacceptable if i am late with rent they wont chase me down call two or three times etc they will post eviction letter and soon the sheriff will be there to put me out on the street ive lived in apartments in 3 states since the 1980s and have never experienced the responsiveness and outright incompetence of management like i have now at parkland commons the place is turning into a dump fast literally as furniture and other large items are overflowing near the dumpster i asked the office about why no one had picked up this junk and the assistant manager said the company that picks up such refuse only comes twice a month well that pile of crap was there last month and the pile has grown and it is now aug 5 and i will bet money it will be sept 5 and the pile of crap will still be there if you need a place to stay in east charlotte i definitely dont recommend parkland commons bow i came home this evening and of course no one had come to dry out carpet nor had anyone bothered to follow up with a phone call or email to say when this problem would be fixed i left message on emergency line and you guessed it no one bothered to even reply|0

this experience was amazing i was a little skeptical with the cheap price and unfamiliar with the company area but i was far from displeased i purchased an 11 day parking pass for 56 that alone is unheard of but they also offer on time and quick shuttle service to and from the airport the lobby is clean with public restrooms snack machines the daily newspaper and complimentary water bottles and coffee the gentleman at the lobby desk was sooo helpful they fill out a piece of paper explaining exactly where you left your car came in such great use after flight delays and an exhausting trip home everything about this experience was great and i will definitely use them every time we fly out of pox|1
stay away this company does not care about its customers has horrific customer service and is completely incompetent when it comes to providing the finished product you order in a timely manner the finished product is nice but not at all worth the hassle of dealing with the company on the date schedule for installation brian very professional showed up with mismatched doors and was unable to re key the security door okay fine the company corrected the color error and returned a week later to install the newly colored front gate door and re key the security door the front gate door was installed without the dog screen that i ordered i had to pull my original paperwork to prove that i ordered and was charged 65 for the dog screen the company never followed up i called and was told the soonest the screen could be installed was in another 3 weeks mind you 9 weeks have already passed since the date of order i was very upset as my dog had already escaped the gate and everything should have been done correctly the first time eco advantage threatened to sue me if i left any negative reviews of the company said he has done it before and would do it again unbelievable an apology kind words and a credit of the 65 dog gate would have been just fine stay away these gates are expensive find a company that values your business there is no reason for you to deal with such a terrible company shame on eco advantage is a serious red flag the form contract basically states in all caps above the signature line that you agree not to give any negative reviews of eco advantage and if you do you will pay eco advantage 2000 for each instance under the consumer review fairness act of 2016 this is illegal and unenforceable but if you dont know the law chances are you wont leave a negative review pops i filed a complaint with the better business bureau eco advantage posted its bob reply below on yelp look the company up on the bob and see the companys full tirade against me and note not once do they address the issues i encountered|0
this place was awesome i attended with 2 10 year olds and a 14 year old and we had a great time i am a local and embarrassed to say that weve not been here before and what a gem i really thought the ad movie on monarchs was a fantastic experience and we learned a lot the staff were very friendly and helpful and the butterflies were just the icing on the cake if you have children that are squeamish about bugs you might want to think twice about this outing we also paid extra for the mirror maze and laser tag and the girls loved that as well overall a great 2 hours out of the az heat i will definitely be returning|1
not a very personable sally location ive been in many times and its taken them 10 minutes to even acknowledge my presence ive worked in retail for a number of years so i know the customer service should be a lot better here keep in mind products are based on demographics in the area they dont have a wide range of products as some locations ive been in just wish they were more helpful and knowledgeable about the products|0
they forget the sauce every single time and are extremely apathetic when its brought to theyre attention horrible burger king|0

woah this place is humongous if you are not careful you could spend hours here they appear to have lots of great deals and have a huge inventory of certain items there didnt seem to be many people around for a saturday but that made it even better for us it did feel a little overwhelming at times due to how large the place is lots of options for all home categories|1

upon arrival i was greeted by barbara who asked me if i was there looking for something specific when i informed her i was just there to browse she followed up with another question about the specific room i was there to shop for again i informed her i was there to browse and was sure to give her the leave me alone look before she left me to walk around she had to ask me one more question are you aware of law boys quality i was very clear with her at this point that if i had any questions or needed her help i would let her know i did not even get half way around the store when lo and behold there was barbara again asking me inane questions like so do you have any questions and did you know law boy offers an in home design service at that point i must ve given her quite a look because she became instantly defensive stating just so you know i dont work on commission i informed her i didnt care how she got paid and my intention was to browse she told me that if her boss sees customers just wandering around she and other workers i suppose would be in trouble yeah okay she just didnt get it at that point i told her i was leaving since being stalked was not on my agenda for the day she tried to say something as i was walking away but i essentially tuned her out its kind of interesting because i read the other reviews and some people had the opposite problem no one helped them its too bad stores like this cant strike some kind of balance between being there for the customer but not bugging them to death oh well i have no intention of returning to see if they ever get it right|0

ok so i have to retire from going out to lunch at this meds what a joke i have given them many many chances and it just seems they will never get it right if you want to wait and have a lot of time to waste this is the place for you how do i order something as simple as a plain my chicken meaning no mayo or lettuce just the darn chicken and bun and people after me ordering burgers that need assembly and even my chickens with lettuce and mayo get served before me i am talking 3 people behind me one person with an 11 order they just can not handle the lunch crowd this happens every time and i am not exaggerating i just dont get it it is almost like you have to except poor service when going here as that is the cost of being able to have a meds in this area also why is only 1 person working the counter i have literally walked in and turned right around when i see 15 people in line and one person taking orders hire another person or pull someone off the drive thru this place is just a failure every time but the turnover is so great that losing 25 customers a day doesnt put a dent in their finances i guess poor service slow service can not handle multiple people in line kinda of dirty and just a hassle 99 of the time i am done with it brown bag it and save and gas while i am at it this is just a sign of the times bad service and nothing done about it if any worker there claims they deserve 15 an hour come sit next to me at work and watch how i handle the workload of 3 people everyday while providing great service not much is asked of these employees and they still cant handle it|0
ill start off by saying i thought our waiter was excellent and did his job fanatically but thats the only positive i have to say calamari was cold spinach dip was like water asked for medium rare cook on my steak it was very well done was fine all day but soon after my not so good meal i was forced to run to the washroom and let me tell you it was not pretty forced to cancel my evening plans i have been running to the toilet non stop for several hours now where it just comes out like water very very terrible experience will not be going back|0

i went to this restaurant saturday for the first time my fiance and i went with a couple who live in bloomfield and go to this restaurant every two weeks or so we walked in and there were already some people waiting for a table we stood near the host area for 10 minutes several employees including the host walked passed us over a dozen times and never said anything to us finally my friend asked how long the wait for a table would be the host looked at us rudely and said i dont know 20 to 30 minutes he was so rude and huffy we left because of how unhelpful the staff was i was excited about dining at this place before 10 minutes of frustration we left immediately and went to the thia restaurant down the street it was excellent and they actually valued us as customers|0
the best part of the meal was our server she was friendly and attentive the food was pathetic ordered potato skins and each one had a few crumbs of bacon and a pinch of cheese about the size of a quarter on each my friend ordered the spinach dip and it was good but i was still disappointed looking at my potato skins sitting there so lonely and naked sat near the window big mistake it was so hot|0

i read all of the reviews before coming here so i had an idea this course would be in rough shape however its hard to turn down a 10 greens fee with cart the first hole was ok but after that it was all downhill there seriously is like a sewer that goes through the middle of this course so it stinks really bad it had rained a week prior and the creek washed a bunch of trash in with it i lost a few drives not because they were in the rough but because i couldnt tell what was a ball and what was a piece of trash i wasnt the only one either i picked up several balls around the course that earlier players had given up on i found the following items a beat up chair 3 tennis shoes tons and tons of trash also the houses surrounding the course are pretty rough and many of the owners have some sort of angry dog how fitting i cant say ill come back here even though the price is cheap the frustration of losing balls well hit makes me too angry|0

my friend and i were attracted to the store by the cute pins and clothing but didnt get a chance to browse for long as the man at the counter was extremely and inexcusably rude to us he asked us not to take any photos of the items which is completely understandable and fair but then he went on to say how he didnt know us and made racist comments about how we might send it to our home country to copy their designs were both canadians of colour completely unnecessary we were pretty speechless and tried to say that we would do no such thing but he rudely and abruptly muttered that he was worried while walking away we left immediately as it was clear we were not welcome|0

unfortunately ive had a not so great experience here as well this clinic came recommended by a friend of mine so i had high hopes but instead i didnt get the care that people normally seek out midwives for first i wanted a more personal connection with a midwife and instead ive seen just about all of them some better than others and have formed no real connection with any because of it the one i really liked moved away and when it comes to your delivery you get whoever you get thats on call for that day not a typical midwife experience like i had with my last one in another city next is that the receptionist was terrible every single time i came in for an appointment she wouldnt so much as look up at you and if she was on the phone you i stand there forever and shed never even say so much as just a second or ill be right with you i even mentioned it to the officer manager after it seemed to be the case every single visit with her last and worst by far is that whatever office assistant it was that was supposed to call me with my 3 hour glucose test results her name was teresa never called me to tell me i actually had gestational diabetes i was only just told on friday after almost 4 weeks since the test and now im 39 weeks pregnant and terrified about how ive had this condition untreated for almost a month when i was supposed to be seeing a specialist for it needless to say im going to a brand new ob tomorrow and am never going back to bethany healthcare in fact theyll be lucky if i dont sue them over this if i end up having complications for this condition with my delivery|0
other than the extreme proximity to my home the only other reason i go to this gym is oscar oscar is my personal trainer that i started with in january 2011 please understand i dont really use him as i should instead i use him as a friend while working out since i moved to az and did not really know anyone oscar is my new friend however oscar has got my ass down 12 labs and in great shape so kudos to hi on to the gym long story short this place sucks no towel service always stinky no cardio to whack group classes this list goes on and on may be i was spoiled at port fitness my last gym but i dont think so seriously this place needs a face lift stat the equipment is falling apart the music is just awful i took a spin class and the music selection by the instructor was the beetles the entire time i u kidding me spin is supposed to be intense i can really appreciate all music but i need fast upbeat high tempo music to spin to and nothing about the beetles does this i go to 24 hour fitness almost everyday so dont get me wrong i do value that i have a gym here in ne mesa but there is no doubt in my mind that the moment another gym comes around i and 98 of the other members just might join since i have been signed up here i have seen a manager fighting with another manager equipment out for days at a time and no cleaning supplies to wipe of your machine after using gross am on 24 hour fitness get it together oh let me go ahead and say one good thing about the gym they offer a kids zone that my son loves to go to and its got pretty good hours although it could be better on the weekends|0

to be fair i never got around to actually using this service because this guy was so rude to me on the phone he interrupted me several times to infer that i didnt have an understanding of how much it would cost where our drop off locations are and how long it would take us to get ready do you realize you are looking at about 300 do you have any idea how far away that is he told me they would need to pick us up 25 hours early because you have girls running around saying they arent ready trying to do their make up not ready on time bottom line this guy was a huge jerk and forgot that i was the customer seeking his service guess i will be looking for someone else who actually wants my money|0

your review helps others learn about great local businesses i will never take my pets to this vet again seems they are more concerned with paying for that new shiny building than whats good for the animals i felt pressured and even bullied at one point to elect to have several expensive treatments done on my animal it was put to me in not so many words that if i loved my pet then i should have these procedures done i really question the ethics of someone who would prey on peoples love of their pets look elsewhere if your e seeking a new vet please dont review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review or if your e connected in any way to the owner or employees|0

place is clean and simple owners are friendly drinks and food are satisfying this place specialize in hong kong style cart noodles and they do a fine job the soup base is not too salty owner said they dont add mug i never got dry throat after eating at little honey the bubble milk tea is unexpectedly good they also offer other he style snacks i like their waffle with peanut butter condensed milk and a touch of sugar brought back a lot of sweet childhood memories the place is relatively new and they still have rooms for improvement but definitely worth a try if you would like to have a taste of authentic he style food note patrons are allowed to park at the condos underground parking|1
i dropped by just to pick up some papers their music was up pretty loud and the joint was totally empty the chick behind the counter was nice though no salesman she made no effort to show me anything or sell me anything even though im always open to new goodies their pipe selection wasnt bad though ive definitely seen better overall it was a substandard shop and the biggest factor for my dropping by was convenience ill probably look elsewhere for future head shopping needs|0
the sauce is very unique i ate a cheese dog and a regular dog both were really good but the melted cheese covering the dog and the sauce was real lull ly really good the toasted buns was another thing that set these dogs apart from what im used to and had before the fries were nothing to write home about and there were some that were really crispy and perfect and other that were some what soggy so there was some inconsistency there i was january so i had to eat inside of my car but i can see that on a summer night or a spring day being able to eat outside would be really great|1

to sum it up somewhat briefly here are the high low lights 1 walked by on saturday night a sign advertising the harry burger with a side for 6 decided to check it out when we ordered the special we were told that the sign was for their lunch and that i guess nobody brought the sign in yet not a big deal it was only a buck more but i noticed that no one went and got the sign even after we said something 2 when we entered we were greeted by women trying to sell us spa products odd they were handing out silk roses which was nice but trying to collect email addresses and giveaway products uh huh 3 sat at the bar waited quite a long time for service considering there were three people behind the bar once we got them the drinks were tasty however the drink pricing was a bit high for sun prairie 15 for two korbell old fashioned i seemed a bit much 4 ordered our food at the bar and then were told that during their rush we were not allowed to eat at the bar so we should grab a table and hed bring the food out rush it was 645 and there were plenty of free seats at the bar this wouldnt have been a problem except the two small tis were hard to see from the table and it was the first day of college football doh 5 after a pretty long wait our burgers came out our appetizer hadnt come out yet when they did the cheese curds were hot and decent but reminded me of something off the schwang i truck 6 burgers were ok nothing special about them 7 waffle fries were good i really wanted to like this place unfortunately there was nothing that stood out enough to go back for|0

as a small business owner myself i normally dont take the time to write a negative review as i know first hand how challenging it can be to be perfect and avoid a concern or complaint with this said the only way i know how to resolve a complaint or concern is to remain in communication and address it head on this is not the experience that we had with michael and loop pools here is the background i am a realtor and my client had to move out for state for family reasons we put her home on the market and she hired michael and loop pools to service her pool since she was no longer living in az to start michael was great he was responsive and had the pool in amazing shape along the way since the home was vacant we had issues keeping the water level at the correct level i personally purchased from michael and loop pools an auto water filler to resolve the situation my plan was to keep the auto filler after the sale of the home so i could use it again in the future for similar needs fast forward to the week prior to the sale of the home the pool was in terrible condition and the buyer who wrote the offer a month prior while the pool was in good condition was not willing to complete the purchase because of the state of the pool my client and i repeat ably reached out the michael to get the situation resolved with no response this resulted in my client having to spend 200 and hire another pool service vendor to resolve the situation to ensure the sale of her home went through on top of this we discovered that while michael charge me 100 for water auto filler he never placed it at the home i again reached out to michael asking that he either refund the 100 or provide me with the water auto filler but he has yet to respond as i said previously it take a lot for me to write this type of review but i am not a loss of what else to do since michael will not return my calls to work out a resolution|0

i hate to leave negative reviews but feel i must for this place granted we were a group of 8 so you expect service to be a bit slower but for crying out loud i never thought wed get our food then by the time they got our last two dishes out everyone else in our group were just about done with their meals so we just got them to go the rolls were good but we were not given plates to eat them on then the bathroom situation at least the womens room three of the four toilets were stopped up and disgusting one soap dispenser was out of soap and the other one didnt work properly our waitress however was very good and attentive none of the issues were her fault and the food that we did get was good they did offer us all free desserts for the inconvenience which was nice it probably comes down to poor management and being understaffed|0

im not sure why the reviews are so high perhaps it was an off night we had dinner here last night and if felt like one thing after another yes we were seated right away at a dirty table ok wiped it off were all good the bread basket is like something from a pre sliced bag from a grocery store the caprese starter was good but they really need to take the tomatoes out of the fridge they were cold hard and a bit grainy the presentation and size was great we both ordered the chicken salt in boca the pro cut tio was overlooked on my husbands and mine was burnt the noodles and sauce were very salty to their credit the food wait time was short our service was terrible in the beginning i said to our server i would just like water when we left my glass was completely empty not even ice in it and had never been refilled not that it wasnt requested when asked about dessert we declined because we just wanted to leave already i can not recommend this place to anyone|0
45 stars was so glad that mon trial had caught on with the i ryo hype we have here in northern california in fact there used to be a toby close by my house but sadly it closed down toby has really good quality yogurt canadians should be thankful i agree with john a white chocolate mousse is probably the best flavor there this location is pretty small but its really quiet and hardly busy so you can grab a cup of i ryo and sit down at a booth and just chill|1

i used 5 guys construction to replace my roof i received 5 estimates they were not the lowest but i felt the price was what i expected everyone i spoke with was congenial and helpful the actual roofers did a great job each and every day and it took less time to complete the job then i expected the last thing done was the supervisor and i surveyed the job to see if anything else needed to be done there were a few issues and they were remedied quickly i would recommend 5 guys construction to anyone|1
we purchased my wedding set at a location in tulsa in the mall the salesperson was awesome in fact we returned on our anniversary and upgraded my stone unfortunately they closed most of their locations and we had to mail my rings in to get checked every 6 months to keep the lifetime warranty that we paid for when we moved to az i was excited to find a location in paradise valley mall originally my center stone was 58 it and we upgraded to 11 it but they used the same prongs my stone came loose and almost fell out at least 57 times over a 4 year period well they closed the pa location so i went to this location in fry marketplace the staff seemed nice i had my rings checked in may and the stone was loose again and they had to keep it for a week to fix it i explained my ongoing problem with the stone and my fear of losing it i told them that if it happened again i wanted a new prong put on i went to have my rings checked on 1214 which ironically was our anniversary and the stone was loose and they had to keep it to put a new prong on katherine assured me the ring would be ready in 48 hours and if they had to order a prong it would be 72 hours i wasnt happy about this and let her know my frustration and that we live at anthem and its quite a drive to come back for the rings i actually spent 326 on 2 necklaces and left i called on 1217 and spoke to katherine and she told me my rings were ready my husband drove all the way over and they were not ready in fact they told him they had to order the prong and it wouldnt even be there until thursday and the ring wouldnt be ready until friday or saturday the sales rep had nerve to tell my husband that there was no pick up date on the ticket and we should have called first really so i called and spoke to i annette who informed me that i would need to call and speak to katherine tomorrow i expressed how upset i was and that i feel the ring we purchased for 7500 is junk and i want some sort of compensation she informed me they could mail it to me are you kidding i will be calling corporate tomorrow and i will be receiving some type of compensation thats the bottom line|0

went here on saturday afternoon memorial day weekend the gardens around the japan house were very nice the japan house itself was closed the idea garden struck us as kind of slapdash a lot of plants crammed into a fairly small space looking at the tags for many of the plants we could have just visited the garden center of our local loves or home depot walked over to the miles i hartley selection garden and the selection was somewhat ah lacking a whole lot of empty ground at a time when you wouldnt expect that to be the case weve been to a fair number of arboreal and gardens around the country this one was unfortunately far removed from the best weve seen|0

hello fellow foodies last night at up i had a late evening craving for mcdonalds was really looking forward to as nice big mac combo to fill my craving however mcdonalds has always been so consistant and i have never had a bad experience with them ever but last night at this location turned out to be a disaster it started at drive through as i approached order speaker i sat there for almost 4 minutes before anyone even acknowledged that i was there and finally when the order clerk came on speaker he asked me to hold for what must of been another 3 or 4 more minutes so at this point i was sitting there for almost 8 minutes without taking my order then after moving to pick up window i waited another 4 minutes before anyone even came to window after handing me my food i had to remind worker that i also ordered a root beer as he failed to give me my drink after getting my order i parked opened my food and to my disappointment fries were stale old and very hard and dry the big mac was cold and didnt taste fresh after my first bite i decided to take everything back and ask for new food they had no issue giving me new food which turned out to be much better and freshly made my experience at this location was terrible so most likely wont be back at least late night with what seems to be in comp it ant staff working at that time of night terrible service be cautious at this time of night|0
i will echo what julie has already said ismael has an incredible work ethic reassured us from the start that are backyard flooring project would be amazing we originally were going to install stamped concrete from another company over our stale cool decking instead ismael had shown us samples of work he and his team had done previously and they were impressive the travertine would be more expensive but ismael gave us a very fair and reasonable quote my wife contacted his references and they all checked out and mentioned that he would provide excellent customer service which he did with our project he was meticulous and detailed we are extremely pleased with how our backyard sparkles and now we spend more time outside than before|1
this iga has terrible customer service many of their so called deals are the same price as usual products that are on special are almost always out of stock or things are misplaced and you get charged the wrong amount at the register they could fix it but why bother lets instead insult the customer we dont care there are also problems with the meat section all the packages are covered in raw meat juice and on multiple occasions i have bought chicken that was packed that day only to open my fridge the next day and the fridge smells horrible and the chicken is off more then one time the aisles are crammed with boxes and inventory that makes it very difficult to circulate as the aisles are already small basically you should only go to this grocery store if you have no other option|0

i had the not so pleasant experience of scraping my car against a cement corner in a narrow parking garage i chose 5 auto body shops to get quotes from based on online research and reviews when i checked out the body shops auto magicians stood out by far 1 their price quote was nearly half of what other shops quoted 2 the length of time for the repair was significantly less than the other shops 3 the service was excellent at the other auto body shops the assessors played up the damage to be worse than it was added other potential things that could be wrong with the car due to the incident and just overall made the whole experience longer and more dramatic than it needed to be at auto magicians tom simply came out to my car took a look described to me what was damaged and whether it would be repaired or replaced and then we went inside to talk numbers he was really straight forward professional and most importantly trustworthy when i got my car back it looked brand new if you ever have the unfortunate circumstance of damaging your car do not hesitate to go to auto magicians they are going to do the best job with the best price to match and you dont have to worry about being ripped off in any way i wish i could give them 10 stars|1

save your time and money and do not purchase anything from this store i purchased a recycled leather recliner from this store in the fall of 2012 for 800 after 2 short years the fabric had begun to fall apart shedding its top leather lining and leaving small remnants all over my apartment as i recall during the sale of this recliner the representative assured me that this product was made to last for a long time this fabric was made out of recycled leather products and i was informed that it would wear and last just like regular leather this was not the case i have made numerous phone calls and emails to allow this company to correct their mistake i have been overly patient but it is obvious that i was sold a product with poor workmanship and quality control after waiting weeks for a response and then going through a slow and painful chain of emails i learned that the fabric has been discontinued they likely know that this product is faulty yet they are unwilling to help me with the mistake they made after months of time wasted negotiations and red tape customer service offered me a 150 discount towards purchasing a new chair which absolutely dumbfounded me why they think i would want to waste more money on their products is beyond me i suggested that they permit me to use this credit for a repair which seems like a much more logical solution to this problem i was denied that request i have given this company and store ample opportunity to correct this mistake yet they seem set on making me jump through hoops to accomplish nothing i would highly recommend you stay away from this company and this store take it from me with the deceitful sales reps and poor workmanship you are better purchasing furniture from any number of their competitors|0

im so depressed to see the negative reviews of this place i ventured here last time in la after canceling my bradley ogden reserve what they had on the menu was very limiting that month or week however many times they change it so we decided to try 808 my plane had gotten in later then we planned so we got there around 930 am the place was still pretty full sparkling water and roy rogers my drink under 21 my father had some sort of wine slash beer combo not together we order appetizers ahi tuna dish that they have posters of all around casino some rolls and then the appetizer sampler for two people we didnt finish it but wow everything was good that tuna was mom wondering where the hell our main dish was i wait another 20 minutes after good conversation when i finally ask my dad he informs me we had not ordered it yet wow what why had i thought we had ordered so we order promptly they had our food out salmon for me halibut for the father in record timing everything was spectacular downside i wish i could have had wine but alas too young still i would go back preferably when i can drink|1
dropped in to leticia i for late lunch today the lunch specials are fabulous and our timing was right to also enjoy happy hour margaritas the margaritas are perfect just the right amount of dusty tequila flavor and the right proportions of sweet and lime the carnitas plate was especially perfect included chi char ones and a bit of guacamole and yes another and a choice of side and tortilla we had already enjoyed fresh tortilla chips and the best salsa ever then we have to say that the service was friendly and helpful we love it thank you leticia for coming to tivoli village we loved this place before we came back tonight for dinner and found the most delicious incredible entree ever gourmet tacos we split them and a table side guacamole the server made stunningly delicious guacamole with just the right touch of chili then the tacos came out ribeye and cheese and that wonderfully smoky chipotle flavor savor is the only possible response sides rajas con crema ay vegetables saute i with love ay ay ay over the top and before i forget the margarita csi ca perfect a pero perfect a|1

not trustworthy at all product didnt seem so bad but people selling are not professional at all lied about pricing told 1 thing and math didnt add up and didnt change it took money on the side and when returned product would not return that money kept and probably hid it from boss we lost money and didnt even get a product complete scam artist beware claim to be tax deductible because profits go to an organization but doesnt not show anything on receipt and u can not deduct just off of someone saying so you need documentation in order to deduct from taxes do not deal with these people|0
great customer service and really good prices not to mention really good i ape try the loaded stores its fire|1
this store has policies that are not consumer friendly i bought a 200 item and came to return it to the store 2 days later without even opening it as i noticed some very poor reviews online and the store refused to give me a refund citing they can only give me a store credit instead when i returned to the store the clerk pointed to some print on my receipt and to a sign that was on their sales counter that was hidden behind some other posters i have tried speaking with their store and their head office but they do not listen the item i bought was a cookware set which i did not even open and it was less than 48 hours from the time i purchased it if they want to enforce these types of policies they should make a customer initial the receipts when the customer leaves the store there is nothing else i need from this store and i am stuck with a 200 gift card and i have no clue when i will ever use it or if this company by way of this poor customer service will go out of business their staff themselves are found complaining online about their policies and this is a known policy problem with this store as i find out now they have a 1 star rating from the better business bureau and it has all to do with return issues these types of stores should not be allowed to operate unless they are very clear with consumers about their policies at the time of purchase and very clear signs in their stores|0
ive used waterworks before and have not been disappointed i knew who to call when i noticed our toilet tank was a bit loose you dont take any chances with plumbing when your e in a condo and though this turned out to be a relatively minor issue that was easily fixed i at least had peace of mind knowing that there was not a major problem brewing from start to finish office manager natasha and plumber jamie were friendly and professional i appreciated natasha fitting me in on an already busy day a great customer service bonus was the email waterworks sent me with james photo saying he was on his way on time and obviously very knowledgeable jamie quickly fixed the problem and showed me how this was done even though i was his last appointment of the day this did not affect james disposition nor his willingness to provide me with some additional tips on condo building plumbing totally worth paying the call out fee and i will continue to use and recommend waterworks thanks michael and team|1

went to this subway for a regular sandwich fix as i walk in to the store theres an elderly man who appears to have parkinson's walking with a crane unable to open the doors to the store he is sitting at the table asking one of the two workers for help choosing a sandwich the employee proceeds to tell the man in an extremely rude tone that the menu is on top of the counter and that he must get up and place an order i confront the employee and explain to him in a calm manner that this man has difficulties with the simple act of standing and should give an extra hand to this gentleman the employee began to tell me to not tell him what his job entails and raised his voice towards me i will not lie i too raised my voice towards him in pure aggravation of this young mans laziness after the altercation he hid in the back and muttered some other things that i could not make out as i was speaking with the other employee once i paid and started to leave the store he comes out of hiding in the back and yelled to me nice tip as i did not leave one i looked at him and smiled uttered more words of disgust towards him and walked away of course i apologized to the other two elderly men in the store as this was not an accurate representation of who i am as a human never have i been more ashamed of my generation i assume this man was my age between 2025 working sat oct 13 and 700 am tall white and with facial hair if your e looking for a store to get a simple sandwich avoid this one horrible staff|0

i took my husbands italian suit pants to this place in a desperate attempt to get the hole in the back of them patched with a two day turnaround i wasnt even sure if it could be done the hole was pretty bad however the lady took a look at them and said she thought she could do it and by the next day as well she charged me 20 which i thought was a great price given the short notice and how bad the rip was sure enough the next day i got a call from her saying she had repaired the pants and they were ready she did such a great job too you cant even tell there was ever a rip ill be bringing all my alteration and repair needs here from now on|1
though i was not the bride i was in the wedding party and i warn all beware of this venue while they may say that its like a one stop shop that only works if their staff is on the same page given the of times you get handed around watch out for sudden price changes that were incorrect by another staff member dont always trust the vendors they select our limousine driver didnt say congratulations to the bride nor help anyone out of the limousine and the two young junior bridesmaids exited first the food was good but the wait staff are young for a venue that specializes in weddings they should hire or train staff to follow some serving etiquette and take care of the head table i cant count the of times that we had to ask them to do something like remove plates that we clearly done and right in front of them heads up the female photographer is very bossy we were warned but when you have to be warned im not sure thats someone id want working with my people at a wedding while the bride said all is well she was just too nice to deal with any drama but for the money my expectations would have been higher in the end while a nice location and good food the staff leaves much to be desired given this is their business|0
switched to this pharmacy from the lola's pharmacy at funds west blood have been blown away by the exceptional service provided by their pharmacist shes friendly knowledgable and will take the time to talk to you about your medication in detail she fills out orders in a reasonable amount of time and unlike lola's pharmacy gives accurate estimates on wait times i couldnt be happier to have to have found her as my pharmacist the building also contains my neighbourhood canada post it sometimes gets quite busy and wait times can be long but i havent been to a canada post location that doesnt struggle with this issue staff has always been helpful and quick the store itself is not large so dont expect the huge variety of products but as a small local pharmacy ive always more than satisfied with what they have to offer|1
our experience at the yard was amazing we came in on a friday afternoon and we spent 2 hours with jamie bus ok a our mission was to select quartz and or granite for 3 bathrooms 2 shower seats a utility room and a giant kitchen jamie took the time to walk us through the inventory of slabs and remnants room by room she offered us water and even a parasol to protect ourselves from the sun jamie dealt with a husband and wife with disparate tastes and a multitude of room applications without losing her mind she even had us compromising and making final decisions within the hour time frame we ended up being able to use several stunningly beautiful remnants and then purchased 35 slabs for our massive kitchen overall the yard had an impressive selection of stone with many pieces ive never seen before after remodeling over a dozen homes in 6 cities across the country ive never experienced such great customer service and prices at a stone yard were coming back when we start building our casita i cant wait to deal with jamie again the yard made it a pleasure to get stone its a one stop shop|1

the grooming services offered at this location leave a lot to be desired if all you want is a basic wash then theyre acceptable but they have no clue how to do a trim for a larger dog when i inquired i was told the only cut they offer is to shave the dog completely the store itself is fairly small and filled with an excess of merchandise making for a fairly cramped environment over all even though theyre conveniently located for me id rather go somewhere that will provide full grooming services|0
after reading all the reviews i thought i would give this place a try i was looking for some 223 rounds and shot over to my surprise the selection was very limited and i personally didnt think the prices were good in fact another reviewer mentioned they rival online prices but that was definitely not the case or at least with 223 the guys working in the shop were friendly greeted me and seemed cool so definitely no complaints in regards to the customer service side of things i will go back to buying my ammo online in bulk1000 rounds online at several different reputable sites are about 100 cheaper than here i also like my local shop for smaller quantities of ammo and gun purchases better prices and selection|0
i would definitely recommend to anyone looking for a juice bar fresh ingredients perfect location|1
i read the reviews we are new to az from ca and gave this place a shot since it is close to where i am temporarily staying not going back again if you want your designer clothes to smell like dirty mop after paying a premium for the service this would the perfect place i dont know what they use or if they even washed my clothes i could definitely not wear them to work today the front desk person is very rude and as a conclusion i am going to drive a bit more and go to tide in ahwatukee edit after owners response the issue was resolved but after a long argument with yo to give the money back the owner claimed that he can not refund money to a credit card you always can refund money to any card you want as a merchant which was not the case for us as we paid cash yes we received a refund for only one pair of pants the owner claimed that he could not smell anything i dont know about you but every one is the house smelled the clothes i dont think 34 people are wrong some advice to the owner dont be offensive to your customers you are in a customer service business being nice and courteous will go a longer way that being rude and blaming the customers this is not my first time going to a cleaners and i am sure it is not your first time dry cleaning either all my clothes smelled like that and i actually would like a refund for the whole amount your competitors give a whole lot better service than you do and if they screw up they admit it and fix it i avoid dealing with business owners like you at all cost and will make that people around me will not go to your shop for the same reasons|0
ive lived at alexander place for almost two years the location of the complex the quiet well kept atmosphere and the friendly neighbors are great its also convenient to have a full size washer and dryer provided in the unit though i love my apartment i will most certainly not be renewing my lease the management staff of the complex continues to show themselves to be disorganized non communicative and disinterested in helping out tenants any time that i have called or dropped by the management office with an issue or question im told something different on multiple occasions maintenance issues have been dragged out for over a week with a different excuse being given every day as to why nothing was done it is clear that this management staff has no pride in their work that they care nothing for providing service to the tenants to pay highly to live in these luxury apartments the upgrades were slapped on so carelessly and cheaply to fixtures that are so sadly outdated its unbelievable to pay such high end prices to receive such low end service the attitude of the management staff appears to be an extension of the property management company the conor group itself at one point when i faced an issue with an employee serious enough to warrant contacting them i placed several calls over multiple days only to finally receive a response from someone in the alexander place office no one from the conor group could be bothered to return a simple phone call the cherry on top of all of this is the mandatory 100 cable and internet fee charged monthly yep mandatory that means anyone who doesnt even use a to or computer is required to shell out an extra 100 for basic cable and the slowest internet speed never have i heard of this being done elsewhere when asked about it the management office stated it has to do with a contract with time warner that they cant even do anything about it but why did they sign up for this contract in the first place a quiet well situated apartment doesnt seem to be enough to make up for a staff that cant be bothered to provide reliable service to its tenants i would not recommend alexander place apartments to anyone the price is just not worth it|0
the new look sort of looks like joanna gaines threw up in here in a good way i dont really go to manera bread that often and was really surprised to walk in for a lunch meeting to see the new look its bright clean and airy i am a sucker for subway tile and earth tones so obviously i was pretty pleased with it another thing i noticed was that there were multiple staff that brought food to tables instead of one of us having to go up to the service window to pick it up im not sure if this is a new thing either but it really made the experience feel a lot nicer tip i always like the self service kiosks because you can custom make almost anything|1
i picked aspen because they had night and weekend hours what a mistake that was they gave me one price paid in full that day 1500 dollars only you get a surprise bill in the mail a few weeks later for another 50000 they also gave me a bag to take home after i was put out the bag had a electric toothbrush in it and i was charged 16000 for that without my permission tooth brush broke after 6 months i will never go to any aspen dental ever again i would rather have no teeth then to return to them|0

something about microwaving each dish really bugs me alex i said it in 2008 and most of what he said rings true with me 2 years and several visits later the flavours can be pretty tasty if its not one of the plates dripping in grease and if your e really stuck for a vegetarian lunch in the area you can take a chance on their daily lunch special otherwise for what it is i do find it pretty overpriced may be eating in is the key the dining room is lovely for a decent place to catch up with old friends over a weekday lunch but overall i much prefer either of the two other restaurants serving asian mock meat on it denis one at sherbrooke and one right above marianne|0
im here to comment on the conduct of one of the tour leaders taking a group of what appeared to be mainly senior citizens on a tour through red rock canyon park today their convoy pulled up into the farthest parking lot at the second parking area after you enter the park the problem was they pulled up on to the side of the walkway right behind parked cars that is where my experience begins i was with my family and we were in the process of backing out with old people in scooters right behind our car it was not safe to do so but tour leader 1 encouraged me to do so after successfully backing out i proceeded up the narrow lane created by the convoy parked safely on the right of us and the series of parked cars on the left the left hand turn i have to make is particularly narrow due to the tour leaders scooter parked in the front of the convoy tour leader 2 is in front of my car and recognizes the situation he has created for me rather than get in his scooter and move out of the way he proceeds to gesture his hands and arms wildly assuming the role of traffic cop i was distracted by what amounted to me to be an unrequested buffoon show as my first pass was unsuccessful rather than allowing me the opportunity to correct my angle myself this buffoon proceeds to come to my drivers side window and put his hands on my steering wheel again i did not request his help in any way shape or form now he is asking me to move my vehicle as he commandeer i the steering wheel to correct my angle my family is looking on with startled discomfort as though to think whats this buffoon going to do next he created a highly unsafe situation as a result of his buffoonery as i was leaving this buffoon decides to save his own face and announce to the convoy of disbelieving tourists that he cant drive are you kidding me you come into my family and my life unwelcomed in the most buffoon ish way create a buffoon ish situation and now try to launch a buffoon ish insult to your paying customers i have not taken this tour would not recommend it based on my peripheral experience and would certainly caution anyone to place there lives in the hands of a clear buffoon tourist leader ruined what was otherwise a lovely family day out|0

we wont be coming here purchased a restaurant com gift certificate for this place on 71112 we find that its a great way to try new places and since this is literally right around the corner from the house we thought it would be nice to try this place decided to stop by for lunch today 72112 and there was a note on the window that they do not accept restaurant com coupons wif went in and asked the hostess and she only confirmed that seeing as how the establishment has to approve their participation in the program and can set limits as to how many gas can be issued i dont understand why they decided not to honor them checked the go and there was nothing as to valid dates no expiration date etc nothing that would cause them not to honor it on this day we will never visit this establishment and make sure that our friends hear of our incident not a good way to try and get established|0
disclaimer this place is new and has a lot of issues to work out okay heres the deal i went to this place on recommendation of another business as i was looking for a location to hold monthly meetings i was looking both on behalf of a fortune 100 company as well as a local 501c3 i saw their facebook page and thought the restaurant looked rather inviting our business associate planned to meet us there and alerted the manager to our meeting we arrive at am empty we thought they were closed at first impression the restaurant is warm inviting and very eclectic so we had high hopes that was the end of the positive experience the manager had stepped out and was not there for our meeting she showed up later the service very slow the wait staff are novices that probably have never served before ever they couldnt get orders right as they didnt listen attentively this was an ongoing issue after a considerable amount of time out comes 3 of 4 orders we wait and wait order 4 comes out wrong and is sent back we wait it comes out and is still wrong all the food is cold i ordered a cheese bacon and sausage omelette side of crispy bacon i got an overcooked egg pancake folder over with undercooked bacon and sausage no cheese the crisp side of bacon was limp and undercooked its as if this was the cooks first gig ever after graduating automotive school and they said he is going to train the new cook if you go for only coffee and a nice atmosphere you might be ok its hard to screw up coffee but then again they an to open at night as a persian restaurant may be they will fare better although they have an identity crisis i will never know as i dont plan to repeat the experience you can have a more satisfying experience with an egg muffin at macdonalds the manager finally showed up for the meeting and talked to us as our food turned cold where is the quality control as i wrote on the beginning they are new so if they get their act together as a wait staff find a good cook get some semblance of quality control at the pass it may turn out to be a viable spot there is one review i read that was a 1 star that guy was dead on right i would question the validity of the other reviews so i coffee shop we will not be bringing business to you we shared a lot of ideas and i did tell you 1 star in person please take the feedback otherwise your restaurant will join the others in that area to shutter quickly|0

stopped by for happy hour on a weekday afternoon ten minutes after we sat down the bartender staggered over and took our drink order what is a manhattan ok its all good lets try a hurricane bartender seemed bewildered as if surrounded by stinging bees how about a draft beer after more delays we finally received our drink orders service was slow incredibly slow basically a sports bar motif with numerous to monitors throughout the bar atmosphere was less than cordial not a friendly place for a quiet drink the other customers seemed beaten down by a combination of bad service and the lackadaisical attitude of the staff|0
this place roasts the coffee right there always fresh food is amazing as well one of the best cups of coffe you will ever have in your life my father is italian and whenever he visits me he complains about the coffee this place dies it right my dad said it was one of the best coffees hes ever had in his life a little out of of the way and the decor is simple but if you are a coffee conn as soeur you will know that this is the best coffee in the city hands down bravissimo coffee tree|1

very good tart frozen yogurt i like the pomegranate flavor toppings are numerous and fresh a bonus for this place is they will add extra yogurt on top of your toppings while the prices may seem high you get a generous amount of yogurt for the price the employees are nice and seem happy unfortunately i dont live close by but i do try to hit up this place when in the area even with yo gels up the street and a new yogurt land coming soon i will probably stick with patronizing this place|1
on my way from hillman library to cathedral of learning i just couldnt help stopping to buy a piece of waffle as a reward for a days hard working i tried cream with fresh strawberries and tried ice cream with chocolate topping the cold ice cream is a perfect match with the hot waffle you should definitely choose this although the price is not low the good thing is you can use card here and no need to worry about for getting bringing some cash with you|1
i absolutely hate this place we bought our scooter on april with and weve already had several problems dealing with the people the dealership is a joke we dropped the scooter off yesterday were told it i be done by today when we called to check eta the guy was hella rude said its on the list they basically dont care if their customers are happy or not make no reparations for the lemons they sell dont buy here|0
being in my forties i wasnt sure about going to a restaurant club type of place i was wrong the food was excellent a great atmosphere great music and the crowd was in their is and is translation no one was looking down at their phones however be warned at 11 am the place transforms into a young crowd really young i recommend it if you are planning to leave at that time|1
manager very rude i am a platinum customer and had to get something notarized the location on cactus didnt have one available told me to get it notarized at ups store and they would reimburse me this manager said no he would not honor that it was 10 but its the principle he said it was up to his discretion i am going to close my accounts and switch banks my discretion keep your promises or lose a customer|0

great store great staff great buys great birds have purchased a number of items here and have always been satisfied from lawn mower to snow blower at a huge discount and ladder to toilet everything performs beautifully they also have a general 90 day return policy which i took advantage of because of faulty solar lights that stopped working after just 2 months never had to return anything else because they all work whether blowing mowing growing brushing or flushing especially satisfied with their outdoor plants always healthy when purchased and continue to flourish annuals perennials and herbs house plants too and if your e looking for any larger decorative garden pieces such as metal realises gates panels and shepherd hooks they have quite a nice selection because a vast section of their outdoor garden center is open at the top like an enormous cage in a zoo but without roofing on one side dont be surprised to be looking at something and all of sudden birds fly past right in front of you just two feet away at eye level and theres constant chirping and tweet ing pretty cool actually its like an aviary they even build nests in the rafters ive never had it happen but you might want to wear a hat just in case|1
oh this buffet was on only after having my girlfriend hassle me about coming here because she was told this buffet was good i finally buckled down and we took the trip to bayside buffet this place did not disappoint the was a great selection of food and the price wasnt shabby considering we shelled out 50 plus on rios buffet thumbs down later on that review and they included beer and wine in the price of the buffett chea so i am a crab leg eat in mutha sustain and i was completely gluten ous with it the crab legs were good not overcooked the salmon with cracker crusted on top was awesome they even had ox tail which i was surprised and they made it better than some of the caribbean restaurants i frequent the shrimp pizza etc for the most part everything was delicious i wasnt a big fan of the sushi but who the hell cares bring on the crab legs we came back here the day after next and it was just as good the service was great the food kept coming nothing left empty clean im a fan thumbs up to bayside|1
so i entered the small patisserie that is known as crepes and bakes the place had a nice quaint look with sitting inside and out sitting down inside we were greeted by who i expect was the owner she was very friendly and very helpful looking through the menu i of course found a huge selection of crepes but also found sandwiches salads soups omelettes scrambles and french toast this of course is a crepe place so why order anything else the question was did i want a sweet savory or breakfast crepe i decided to go with a sweet fresh strawberry crepe with custard i split that with a friend who went with a breakfast scrambled egg crepe with salmon and cream cheese the owner waitress asked if we would like to add capers or onions for no extra charge we went with the capers no onions another guest with me went with the nutella french toast the food arrived and everything looked amazing the strawberry crepes were great the crepes even seemed to have homemade whipped cream which just added to the great taste the breakfast salmon crepe was awesome too there were just enough capers to dot the scrambled eggs without being too strong i would highly recommend it i had a bite of the nutella french toast and it like everything else was very good the nutella gave it a unique but good taste that is typically not found in the united states i would definitely go back and orders from the crepe section without hesitation|1
simply horrible the place was unhygienic they reused toe separator and pedicure flip flops when i got my manicure the towel i was told to put my hands on had loose nail clippings on it from a previous client i went in for a manic edi and was there for 35 hours which is way longer than necessary my manicure was horribly done with polish all over my skin i had to ask for the girl to clean it up in the end a different lady came to finish the manicure i got was shellac and was told that it would last anywhere from 34 weeks it lasted 8 days i called to inquire about a redo or refund and was instead yelled at and then hung up on by the lady on the phone i tried calling back and they would not answer i do not recommend this salon to anyone|0

wed been meaning to visit terrazzo for quite some time it has an endearing story from the owner printed on the menu the food was excellent exactly what you crave when you feel like homemade italian you can smell the food from a block away we ordered the bruschetta which was a great size for sharing and each had a pasta dish both were so flavourful and the pasta was perfectly al dente the patio is very quaint and garden like our server was attentive and service overall was excellent we were even offered a complimentary dessert for a slightly longer than average wait time for our main courses which we hardly noticed in the first place we cant wait to return this will definitely be a new neighbourhood favourite|1
gere my and scott are a great team and did a thorough job keep up the great work|1
went on a friday night a little after up and there were 3 tables occupied went with 3 other couples we quickly got our first round of drinks and ordered our food then it all went downhill we waited over an hour for our good when we finally received our food it would come out 1 or 2 meals at a time with at least a 10 minute lapse in between the next meal delivery drink refills were also ridiculously slow the food was good but i think thats because we were starving by the time we received it we were dining with friends not eating in shifts no apologies nothing from the 3 waitresses on duty mind you there were only 4 tables occupied at any given time on fri night ridiculous icing on the cake was the bill had not been separated like asked and gratuity was built in will never return|0

i have had several appliances repaired by appliance repair today and always have found them to be honest on time and up front with their pricing the most resent repair to my sassing dryer was quite a process the parts had to be special ordered i was informed up front by the technician it could be quite a process so unless i had 4 weeks to wait for the part i should replace it i opted to wait the four weeks the i was given a loaner until the part arrived the repair took less than 15 minutes and saved me 800 so in the end i am very happy|1
i paid the jacked up 150 july ith sunday service rate and the tech couldnt fix it but was supposed to order the part i needed asap the office didnt even get around to ordering it until 4 days later wednesday nice just for grins they scheduled us to have it installed on tuesday and of course never showed up no part duh they never even called to at least give me an update and when they say they will call they are at lunch or called in sick or at the dealership working on a truck so now five days later we dont have ac and they still dont know where the part is they should have stopped accepting work their inadequate back office cant handle but their greed seems to think that if they get you in the pipeline they will get your money instead of another service company they are either way understaffed or way incompetent either way id avoid them like the plague|0

this bar looks high end and has high end prices while the drinks lived up to their prices the service didnt the washrooms were gross so we only stayed for one drink so we could avoid them the waiter appeared annoyed we were there i contacted the bar to discuss our visit but they have yet to reply so the rating stays at 25 should likely be 15 but they did give you free yummy popcorn so it gained an extra star|0
i went to this ae outfitters yesterday looking for an off the shoulder top the context is friday night around up so the store was not busy i looked around for a bit then asked one of the salespeople for more options he was quite helpful and showed me a couple of styles and led me to the dressing room i had about 4 tops with me i tried them on and found one i liked that was a bit too big so i pressed the button in the dressing room to get assistance i waited for a bit no one answered so i walked out and saw a staff person sitting on one of the high chairs in front playing a game on her cell phone professional i called her a few times she ignored me then may be on the ith or ith call she turned around and said she was on break she quickly gestured to someone on the floor who was helping another customer the other salesperson saw me said she would help me in a bit so i went back inside the dressing room and waited and was just about to leave when the salesperson came and asked me what she could get i told her a smaller size but she came back empty handed fair enough so i decided to take the top anyway and made my way to the cashier no one was there i waited for a bit but then got fed up and threw the top on the counter and left no one knew or cared basically i was like shut up and take my money and this poor quality store could not be bothered the only reason im giving this place 2 stars is for the first salesperson who helped and checked up on me but with three people surrounding me and only one person who actually did something they couldnt even make a sale ae needs to be better with managing salespeople and their etiquette full disclosure i am annoyed right now so my words will be a bit more biting but here it goes i get that the store is in a hipster neighbourhood fashion district but lets be honest here ae is neither high end or great quality i expect at least a modicum of respect in any store and at the very least for someone to be at the cash counter i wonder if theyre hemorrhaging money with so many salespeople plus isnt it the point of hipster neighbourhoods to give the customer more of a personalized experience i did not get that here|0
i got my suv detailed today and it looks 23 years newer the detail of getting dirt in the door jams and in the back ith door as well as air vents dash display cup holders and door pockets just makes it look sharp jeremy and joshua were kind and thorough well definitely recommend dynamic detailing|1

extremely unprofessional office staff specifically the clinic manager and the appointment coordinator you get the run around via email constantly they will never return a phone call also the student future doctor will not return an email or phone call message yes it is a lot less expensive than a traditional office but that is really the only perk it is sad how they are preparing the future doctors for the real world where they will have to communicate with people|0

i thought this would be a friendly place to eat and i was very disappointed the waitress was so rude we waited ten minutes for a table that was sitting empty the whole time we were waiting then when we finally got to sit down and order it took a good 45 minutes for our food to come out and the waitress didnt check on us once that whole time not to refill our drinks or anything it was loud uncomfortable and the service was awful the food was good it was just hard to enjoy it after such a long frustrating wait i love the idea of checking out little hometown spots but this is the type of place that makes you scared to try someplace new|0

first of all 1 star should not be given to this restaurant food quality is not bad they try hard however what made me to write the review for the very first time is for their very upsetting service we ordered 6 orders of pork belly biq and soup side order it was served with 8 lettuces leafs for 3 adults to share and when we asked for more they said it would need to be a extra order what shouldnt you be serving the right portion of vegetables when customers are expecting to have authentic korean biq and the answer we got was that they have limited portion per order are you kidding me clearly 8 lettuces leafs does not serve 600g of pork belly but we didnt wanted to ur gue back so we just ordered the extra vegetables servers did not come back to check on our table until we asked for the cheque normally at korean biq place they offer to change your grill if it seems to start burnt but this place ignored our table and let us grill on the burnt grill horrible lastly we had our 3 yr old son with us and saw other tables getting an ice cream as they asked for their bill so we asked if we will get one and the answer was no since we did not order a combo so we kindly asked if only our child can get one as he could not take off his eyes on those ice creams and they also said no because we did not order the freaking combo wow that just threw us off for that one scoop of green tea ice cream this restaurant had to be that cheap my experience at this restaurant is so horrible that i want to call every inspectors that could possibly visit to restaurant and let them cat oh whatever shady thing they might do and give this restaurant no chance for business horrible disgusting has no sense of customer service|0

i needed to get something for lunch and that fast i ended up at pumpernickel and ordered their warm schnitzel sandwich with sauteed onions the schnitzel was crispy and tender and tasted pretty good unfortunately the sauteed onions were bland it lacked seasoning and was just sweet all the ingredients combined added up to an ok sandwich but thats all considering this is a sandwich off their menu and not a build your own they should have put more thought into how to combine ingredients to make the sandwich a tasty experience i feel that they failed with that it is not the worst sandwich but it just didnt wow me either after trying this sandwich i wished i had gone across the street to top which i know always have amazing sandwiches my tip go to top three little pigs|0

although we really like the atmosphere the beer selection and the burgers we would probably not go back as a family we went last night around 430 am and so far so good happy hour started and then for whatever reason they cranked the music to the point where our server couldnt even hear us order and we could no longer have a conversation at the table kids loved their pizza i loved my gorgonzola burger the pizza was kind of meh but not awful server was good too but based on the noise alone we would go for a happy hour without kids|0

my coworker recommended this restaurant to me but warned me that the customer service was not the best well that was definitely an under statement to say the least my friend and i arrived about up on friday night there were two other people in the restaurant we waited about 5 he for service before i got up and went to the bar to place my order only to be told to go and sit at a table and wait for a waitress to come and take my order we should have ran out the door right then there well the wai trees finally comes over and was pleasantly polite i ordered the chicken patties and the stew chicken and my friend orders a beef patti and a combo meal of jerk and stew chicken both patties were cold when they arrived to the table u gang but had good flavor so we continued to nibble finally our food comes out and it was not the jamaican style food that we were expecting my friend and i picked around our food and chatted for about another ihr mind you no one ever came back to our table to check on us i get it though after sitting there for a while we noticed that most customers come in to order and take food out my friend walks to the counter to ask for our check and before she could get the words out of her mouth the owner blurts out its going to be 5 he maam my friend replied for what my check the owner feeling a little silly calls for the waitress that took our to prepare our checks well it took 10 or minutes before we finally received our checks unbelievable the customer service here is the i rost i have experienced in all my dinning experiences and i will never visit this restaurant again nor recommend to anyone that i know|0

three issues with this company 1 when i looked them up doing research in the federal motor carrier safety administrations online database theyve had their operating license involuntarily revoked twice 2 when i google searched them i found theyre a defendant in a case in federal court wherein a pedestrian was injured and they did nothing about it for years and 3 i also found a public utility case about what sounds like the same accident only it suggests that the company didnt even investigate or respond to the pedestrians claims and the jury is still out about whether and how long theyll be allowed to continue operating this time pretty damning stuff|0
i recently went on a friday after work for dinner to bring home i ordered the 8 piece grilled with mashed potatoes and green beans i had not been to a kentucky fried chicken for some time and this trip reminded me why i had stopped eating at this chain the chicken pieces were small with small bones the meat was dry the potatoes probably come out of a box and luckily there was enough gravy to make it palatable the green beans looked like they had come out of a can and had been cooked too long so they were such a dark shade of green that i wasnt quite sure they were green plus the container was loaded with water the biscuits were very dry but with some butter and nuked in the microwave they were edible on the plus side the people staffing the drive thru seemed nice and decent unfortunately after spending 20 to get dry food the staff is not enough to bring me back to this restaurant this is a place to be skipped|0
beep beep beep flat line what do you do when your bike dies take it to rage cycles i have to say i love this place for one its privately owned and secondly all the employees are super cool laid back and very helpful they know their bicycle mythology well walking into rage you feel right at home and comfortable even if you are an amateur rider many places like this would make the average biker feel like an outcast or a sell out because you have a real job but not rage they are just simply cool if you have a problem yo theyll solve it and for a decent price i have taken my mountain bike here twice for service and both times i had it back in a week tip top shape and it didnt put a dent in my wallet they have plenty of custom bikes to look at and tons of parts accessories and all the equipment any biker would need whether you have a street mountain or whatever bike i highly recommend rage for all your bicycle needs parking is in the rear and they are open until up most days its not the easiest place to find but its worth looking for if you have bike trouble|1

this hospital actually deserves two reviews one for the hospital itself antiquated small rooms uncomfortable and outdated ors recovery rooms and patient rooms beds are uncomfortable and some machinery doesnt work my call button broke one day generally awful though i had a great view of the lake i had no choice as the cleveland clinic surgeon working on me works out of there having a choice there would be several other hospitals i would choose first and im frankly shocked that the clinic hasnt begun updating this place yet however my experience with the staff was fantastic unlike other hospitals ive seen i had absolutely nothing but positive experiences with every member of the staff from nurses doctors and the like down to the housekeeping people they were all respectful polite and very helpful as well as very good at their jobs now if they could just be put into a decent facility|0
they definitely scam on their discounted school rentals i called all around and most places wanted a deposit yeah that sucks but as long as you dont break the instrument you get it back they as i it was 15 plus tax for 3 months im like thats all you pay the person at the store said yes i send the woman and the kids in when we get there shouldve known better they open a cleaning kit and dont eve i ask if we want it and ring it all up its over 50 the most hilarious part is i look at the paperwork and theyre claiming this beaten to tell instrument is worth 1400 the same model brand new is less completely shady company|0
abstract go to a hardware store theyll give you more information and get you out the door with the items you need worst bike shop ive ever been too they seemed nice but ended up being rather condescending i went in knowing what i needed and the first time i was turned away and told to come back with my bike to make sure i got the right size bolt fine no problem i went home and came back with my bike on entering the store the second time i received the same nice yet condescending attitude from another employee possibly manager or owner he tried to help me with the front fender issue but ended up giving me a pair of bolts that were too short as i said it would be and nuts for my rack issue he told me that the shop could install it for 20 thats absurd i already had the rack on 90 of the way before taking it off to take my bike to the store and all i needed was a comm bolt to replace the comm bolt that was too long i was told just to grind down the bolt i have even though i was willing to pay for the comm bolt really glad they didnt charge me for the garbage bolts they gave me this might be the closest bike shop to my apartment but you can bet ill never go there again|0

i have been going to this veterinarian hospital for a little over a year now for my cat yrs dog yrs i have found that the employees are always friendly and will giggle and joke around with you the main do that i have delt with has always been honest and has never made an attempt to cash grab even when i was in a panicked state and insisted on him giving my cat an xray he advised after giving my cat a physical that he was confident my cat didnt need an xray i told him that because of past experience i wanted to see for myself and so he did and he was right he also wrote down a few natural solutions to a few problems i was having with my cat so that i could try them at home before having to come in and spend any extra money i took my dog to the same do because he was limping about after every major walk play date with other dogs he advised us that he thought it was minor rather it is in his one knee and to try this certain vitamin in his food rather than medication to help his pain we havent noticed the limping since the at home tips theyve given me have been so helpful unnecessary yet they still give them i have the genuine feeling that they care more about my pets well being than the extra buck theyll make on an unnecessary xray|1
when this location opened my condo was reassigned to this store ive ordered from them at least a dozen times they have never got a single order right not one even a broken clock is right twice a day did they acquire legal cannabis before the rest of the country are they hiring people who read and write english someday some brave y el per may solve this mystery my last pizza was missing a topping and was cut incorrectly is it possible to order from the clinton location because this location clearly just cant follow orders and instructions from their website they also dont seem to accept the same promotions for example my loyalty to this franchise recently awarded me with a free pizza from points they charged me 6 delivery|0

the gym itself is fine the staff here is pretty lack luster bordering on abysmal on monday the paper towel rack closest to the front desk sat empty for 45 minutes on my way out i alerted the clerk who i believe is the manager of the issue without saying a word he handed me a roll of paper towels now it is no issue for me to put some towels on a spool but i am not being paid to stand around and do nothing else of value i do not work at planet fitness it is your job and if you want me to do it for you at least say please and thank you not scowl at me like a petulant child|0
annas linens is the first place i go when i need bedding etc because their prices are fabulous i went there to do some shopping for a gift and bought a sheet set and a comforter well i was distracted and left without the comforter two days later i noticed it when i went to my trunk to wrap the gift i went back to the store and explained my dilemma the store was fabulous about the whole thing they went into the back and checked the cameras and saw that i did leave the comforter at the cashier they gave me a replacement with no hassles and the whole process only took about 15 minutes including the store checking the cameras i feel that this was definitely above and beyond and really excellent customer service thank you annas linens|1

so glad that i found this place on yelp i went for an ultimate facial which was wonderful renee was very knowledgeable and really took the time to listen to my skin concerns the facial itself was amazing its not so much of a relaxing facial and more of a results based facial that uses three different technologies either way i was still fairly relaxed and felt that my skin had a nice glow after the facial i will definitely come back again only thing that could have improved the experience is if some music was playing during the treatment and or may be a hand massage between treatments i found it less relaxing to just have silence between the different techniques that were used renee did provide a great head massage during the mask application though also the prices were very reasonable check it out|1
not bad its hard to find a good hot dog in tempe by good i mean hot dog cart good because thats how hot dogs were meant to be this place is pretty good but my review might be weird the worse part of this whole place is the actual hot dog itself i know how can i say its good and not love the dog they are cooked to perfection and wrapped in the perfect amount of bacon which for me is not a lot just enough to know its there and the bun is one of the best ive ever had coke in a bottle from mexico yes if they would just buy better hot dogs this place would be epic anyhow i still give it 4 stars because i would and will go there next time i want a hot dog ill change it to 5 stars if they start serving some sort of all beef kosher like dogs|1

a few weeks ago while driving around i noticed a few people walking into this hole in the wall type of place didnt think much of it at the time but every time i drove by after that my curiosity kept making me wanting to find what this place was all about last night was the night in which i hadnt even finished my plate of delicious grilled goat with rice steamed ca badge and spinach with some black beans in which i was already planning my next meal here to tell you the truth the service was a little slow the original menu item i wanted wasnt available the chief cook had the night off and they offered me and my friend the grilled goat and the marinated chicken by the end of my meal i was thankful i had the goat it was beyond amazing i must say that i am ready to try more somalian dishes im sold on it next time im trying the kabobs with the yellow rice|1

i wont trust this place i got my oil change last month and they said when i arrived my oil is licking apparently i got my last oil change from them so when my car was done the mechanic said that i need a oil pan gasket well after driving for a week i noticed my licking is getting worse so today i took my car to a preferred auto shop and the mechanic showed me a red colored sealant around the oil pan screw so that means they didnt tell me anything about the red stuff so all i needed was a washer in between the oil pan and the screw|0

i came across this place through a voucher i purchased you would think that the spas location is situated in the addison but its not they are located in the vicinity of the hotel but are not a part of the hotel services so dont be fooled by the great location i purchased a 2 he nail rejuvenation spa package which was supposed to include a deluxe manicure pedicure massage and paraffin wax treatment however i was out in 1 hour 40 minutes the owner was the one who did my session and once she realized i was a voucher customer her customer service appeared to go down the receptionist was absent that day so she kept disappearing in midst of my session to attend phone calls they didnt use water to soak my hands for the manicure she said it wasnt needed also her nail polish application skills were not very polished massage was for 2 minutes tall claims on voucher like reflexology points will be used rubbish she seemed eager to just get the session over with the uv dryer was not used to dry the nails because she said the top coat should suffice and the dryers were very slow anyways as a result polish was chipped while i was in salon itself the voucher was for 29 and after tax and tip it was 47 forget a spa experience me thinks a regular manicure pedicure at any other place has better standards and customer service there are lots of places around this area that offer manicure pedicure for 35 may be a regular priced customer will get better service compared to voucher customers i had unfortunately purchased 2 vouchers and i was soooo unhappy when i walked out thinking that now i am stuck with it and who the hell would want to come back to such awful customer service however the deal sharing customer service refunded my voucher back phew|0
i have heard and read many bad things about the port union drive test center so i felt it was necessary to share my positive experiences at this location i got my go go and i all at this location and passed each of them on my first try coincidentally i did my go and i driving test with the same examiner shout out to examiner 367 because he is awesome he made me feel very comfortable because of his friendliness and gave clear instructions while on the road i made a few minor mistakes on the road and he corrected me on the spot without yelling at me or making me feel bad making it feel more of a learning experience than a nerve wrecking test the only thing that i dislike about this center is the parking lot depending on how busy it is and how good of a driver you are it may be difficult to park because the spots are narrow some are on small slopes and some are slightly crooked otherwise my experience was great but i also think who you get as an examiner can make or break whether you pass fail and how your experience is but i guess this goes for anywhere|1
i was seated for one person when i came in the girl sat me near the washroom and gave me a menu the store was not busy i waited for 20 minutes and tried to get the server 5 of them standing there that were at the front cash eye contact no one looked at me so after 5 mins more of waiting i walked up to the front and asked the cashier is anyone going to take my order the 4 ladies looked at each other and one said oh did anyone not take your order and i said no i was waiting for my serve to come back but no one came i asked to change my seat to the front of the restaurant the girl took my older but really seemed like she didnt care i was very disappointed with the food quality and the service i cant believe they forgot about me its not like the attire was supper busy there was only 5 people in the restaurant and 5 servers doing nothing but talking to each other never again the worst service|0
i write this review because this winchell i blows my mind away i see it every time we drive earth to the zoo drive ins and texas station and i want to post this business again with its actual title instead of the one provided under this address this location is a combo business but this one is winchell i doughnuts and subway sandwiches thats right jared eat healthy subway sandwiches paired up with a doughnut shop i think its hilarious i think its brilliant i have no idea how this happened i have no idea what the pitch men said in pairing these 2 its the only combo location like this in town there is another odd combo aw root beer and long john silvers that has a couple of locations ive seen but this combo seems to flat out contradict itself for anyone going to subway for a healthy lunch its also a testimony to anyone who goes here and does not order off the doughnut menu what motivation what self control they have and yet business wise its shooting itself in the foot or doesnt it if it caters to both sides of the health food is treat yourself debates and while winchell i isnt health food its not outright hard core junk food to whats out there its still a fresh perishable food you leave it in the box on the counter for a few days it turns rock hard and expires at some point in the week kids can have a diet of sour candies and mountain dews and all those baked goods machine wrapped for the convenience store that have the 40 preservative chemical contents to make their shelf life to the next decade i love winchell i i love subway and i cant wrap my mind around getting both at the same time until now but and some twisties please no ive got to eat this here now coffee or soda|1
id like to have given this place 25 stars some very good elements and some very poor ones as well we did their defused room first the good with the use of a group on the price was very reasonable the room had decent decorations and good technology two of the clues were very smart and a lot of fun to solve the negatives other clues had no basis in logic we spent 20 minutes trying to solve a single clue and when we were given the answer it was hard not to be really angry i dont believe that many people if anyone would have jumped to the silly conclusion of how to get the correct answer the person who ushered us into the room gave us information that was very misleading finally our room was right next to another which is of course fine but they had a large group just outside our room who were loud for almost 10 minutes of our time they certainly should have been kept in the lobby area once in the room they were still very loud but i imagine not much can be done about that back to the positives the employees asked us what we thought and seemed to care about our constructive criticism it seems as though theyre willing to make changes based on feedback ultimately i dont know if ill go back again for a second try they did enough well that im tempted but enough wrong so i might not waste my time|0
do your research if you shop here we were on vacation in az and happened upon this store in the mall the store manager and another sales associate helped my daughter who purchased a pair of boots in the 510 minutes we were there there were no issues the staff were pleasant the shoes were nice and we were happy with the purchase after leaving the store we happened to check the stuart whitman website and discovered that the same shoes were 25 off online and in the stores no one mentioned this at anytime while we were in the store wearily drove back to get a price adjustment several implausible excuses were given for not informing us of the promotion which included corporate has told us not to tell customers about this discount unless they ask and you needed to receive a code in the mail to get the sale price reprehensible to sacrifice integrity for store sales be very very wary|0
overall the customer service when i picked up the truck was great i forgot to mention applying an employee discount and in they advised they would need to start the order from the beginning in an effort to save everyones time the gentleman behind the counter told me i could use the employee code when i dropped off the vehicle well imagine my surprise when i drop the truck off and theres someone new behind the desk who refuses to give me the discount because it wasnt done in the beginning i was pissed overall the truck was good but they need to communicate with each other and if your an employee they need to give the discount regardless of how its applied|0

from september 2010 visit decided to dine here spontaneously after the boyfriend won a bunch of money in the casino there was a short wait since we didnt have reservations once we sat down it took a long while to be greeted by the time someone came around we prompted him with questions and were overeager and excited to start ordering he told us he wasnt our server ummm ok thanks so by the time our actual server around we were so oooo ready to order we all wanted the prime rib thats what theyre known for us course they were out not only were they out they were rude about it like we were supposed to know well if the host had told us or may be we would have known or if they server told us before taking our order may be we would have known whatever we got the stuffed mushroom disgusting didnt know you could mess such a thing up it was a hard ball of fried grease who fries a stuffed mushroom the rest of our meal wasnt memorable we spent a lot of money and expected more out of this restaurant i wouldnt go back sad because we enjoyed our stay in the hotel|0
great food been there may be six but i never got a chance to try the cornbread because its always gone|1
great place to get a hair cut im rather picky about where i get a hair cut usually i end up not coming back let alone scheduling another appointment becca is my barber stylist she really listens to what her client wants and really delivers she pays attention to the little details and offers suggestions to help shes worked with me for the last 6 mo and i dont think ill go any place else as long as shes there its on he pricier side at 30 for a hair cut but definitely worth it when i trust that ill come out looking better than when i went in which is always the concern for anyone getting a hair cut at any place|1
im kinda disappointed we came three times all three were terrible place is lovely tables could been better placed good decoration too much money spent to have skids of water and pop in the corner staff is amazing helpful kind engaging food not sure how to explain falafel were like rocks the gaff a bread is not great taboo leh thats an insult call it burg ul salad call it parsley but taboo leh it has no sauce it is dry we were very exited to have a place as such opening but unfortunately it is not great unless this is what israeli cuisines is supposed to taste|0

this place is amazing not only do they offer great prices and solid work but when i totaled my car 4 days after having some major maintenance done they spoke to the insurance adjuster with me and made sure he was aware of how much money i spent on the car just the week before they actually helped me get all the money i spent on maintenance back through my insurance claim you cant beat that kind of service|1

i was honestly a bit disappointed with this boucher having had such high expectations this isnt a completely bad review but it certainly isnt a positive one the place is nice clean and the staff is friendly the problem i have with this place is the pricing i get it its old aged expensive beef and the quality is superior ive had a lot of steaks in my lifetime as a cook but i cant seem to find a reason to price steaks at such an outrageous price if you have the money to spend go for it but if your e looking for a decent steak at a decent price i would highly not suggest this place|0

i am so disappointed at this place came here because saw the 4 stars on yelp the rolls i small in size because they are cut into 8 pieces when at other restaurant it is normally cut into 6 pieces the orange sauce they put on the rolls taste like mayo mix with spicy oil sauce which doesnt go with sushi all you can eat places have better quality|0
this is my favorite butcher shop at the moment the first impression is that the shop is extremely clean which is important to me for meat shopping the selection is very wide in beef poultry chicken lamb and they also have a seafood section in the back of the shop and a big selection of different types of sausages my most purchase included chicken souvlaki texas bourbon skewers and honey and apple chicken sausages all the other cuts of meat look really fantastic and the presentation of all the stock was fabolous their freezer is stocked with different savory pies and they also have other prepared foods the butcher shop is my new go to for meaty needs i will likely go back this week for a piece of roasting beef|1

most unorganized place i went when we sat down 1 person said this is reserved and i asked where is the sign we ordered foods were getting ready by the cook and keep putting on pickup center but between 9 wait staff nothing was going to tables each food was sitting there for 10 minutes our food came and i touched was cold and told the waiters that i want fresh because its been sitting there and its cold with attitude she shows the other side of resturant and replies that you see its busy took the food back change the sausages only and in 1 min brought it back to me my sons wife and daughters food were cold as ice very bad management poor wait staff if you like cold breakfast then go here otherwise dint because you will waste tour money|0
salem village cotton drive dil wor i 1 for great location a step back tonight 1995 when they were built popcorn ceiling and standard cheap beige carpet with linoleum in the bathrooms and kitchen very budget white countertops and cabinets throughout master bath has yellow stains on the sink where it has been burned and the finish is coming off the mirror leaving it black master shower area not enough room to even turn around with the door open this leaves you with a feeling of being in a cheap motel none of the appliance are digital even the thermostat appears to be 25 years old very tiny refrigerator with wire racks very poor drywall patching throughout the house you can still see the holes the balcony is splattered with white paint from the careless painters 7 ceiling light fixtures and very outdated brass chandelier in the dining area my move in maintenance request was submitted 3 weeks ago nothing has been done all in all this makes me feel very unappreciated and unhappy about the whole situation i regret signing a one year lease all in all the location is great if you can overlook the living conditions|0
by far my favourite italian restaurant in town over the years of going there and having events we have gotten to know the head chef charles not only is he a fantastic chef who always surprised us with new specials but he is a very accommodating and compassionate man when my grandfather was in the hospital he refused payment from my grandma and even sent her home with a pizza to alleviate her from cooking that day every time someone asks for an italian restaurant i always recommend panini cappuccino|1

par tell specialty pharmacy is the worse pharmacy in the world they should be closed down i have been trying since december to get my re filled even with the dry office calling and faxing them they can not get it correct 5 trips ive made over the last 3 months i went in today after confirming by phone with the pharmacist yesterday that its correct and ready for pickup they look at me like they dont understand why i came in since they have nothing ready for me then when the woman at the counter went in back to have the compound filled she comes back with a jar dated 242013 that is scheduled to expire on 34 and tells me i should have come in on time to pick it up i almost screamed i was there in december again in january then on feb ith again on feb with because they kept saying my doctor wanted me to have pills instead of a compound except they were incorrect they wouldnt believe me the dry office or even the empty jar i brought in that had been previously filled from their pharmacy i finally got them to fill it but i think they just changed the label to show a different date when i asked how can i prevent this from happening again she looked at me with a straight face said next time come in on time to pick up your prescription they should be investigated|0
i had managed real estate offices prior to moving to phoenix i felt so fortunate that at a caldwell banker residential brokerage convention i attended in new orleans i got to meet karen we spoke for a while and she gave me her laminated business card i had not anticipated my husband getting transferred to the phoenix area a year later however when he found out he was being transferred i located her business card and first called her broker to inquire about her and he gave her rave reviews i called her and when we came out to find a home she sold us a great home in scottsdale i did not know at that time that we would eventually end up in the same office i was managing an office in another area of phoenix and with a caldwell banker acquisition i was so fortunate to become the managing broker in the scottsdale office and get to work with karen i was constantly getting calls from her very satisfied buyers and sellers giving her rave reviews also i recommend her as a wonderful honest and very hard working person and one of the top real estate salespeople in our company and nationally i also consider her a great friend|1

i went to christie with two friends last night and have never in my life experienced such a deceptive and predatory environment they lie cheat and steal every penny from your wallet i have a feeling that this is what their staff is instructed to do i bought three shots of jack and the waitress tells me i owe her 25 yikes so i gave her two twenties and she disappeared with it never to be seen again nobody ever gave me change for it thats the same thing the doorman did when i handed him a twenty twenty dollar cover charge are you kidding me my buddy bought two bottles of water and was told it would be 12 his bank called him this morning about a suspicious charge they charged him 200 for two bottles of water criminal and at one point a dancer just randomly tried to hit him up for five bucks she hadnt danced for him or chatted with him or anything just went up to him and requested a five dollar tip for nothing weird the service in this place is beyond deplorable they only bothered to serve us twice and then just ran off with my cash and ran up my friends credit card they are crooks ive been to plenty of strip joints and never experienced a fleecing like this take your wallet somewhere else|0

i visit ve all the time but i havent had the luck i once did i once stumbled upon a brand new keri for 499 still in the plastic with manuals with the only thing being wrong was the box was opened and a little worn i also picked up a goomba for the same price that just needed a new battery lately ive found few deals or treasures at this location my dad and i generally visit after needing to walk off a meal not really looking for anything in particular ive been watching this poor penny brand pink cooks coffee maker sit on the shelf for months that really just needs discarding as there is a hole in the base unless you are desperate avoid the last wednesday of the month when they have their half off sale or find someone to go with you and line sit it can take half an hour to check out especially when there is a price discrepancy it would also be nice to alert new customers items marked with an i are excluded from the 50 off sale i once had a friend wait forever with some bath towels only to get to the register and learn this|1

i admit that i usually reserve 5 star ratings for the places that really wowed me and i honestly can say i was pleasantly wowed by this place and the customer service of benjamin leung or ben i was recently diagnosed with sleep apnea and my doctor had referred me to another crap clinic to get a machine i had no clue that i could actually shop around had i known i wish i came here first after purchasing the machine and being on it for the first week i was absolutely dying i felt much worse then before i started crap therapy i was a habitual mouth breather and was on the pillows mask i found i was still leaking a lot from the mouth and wanted to get a full face mask thinking this may help improve things i googled around and found mic sleep and snore clinic on leslie they are located in the plaza right off of and facing leslie with the tim horton upon walking in i was pleasantly greeted by ben though he was in the middle of things with another client i told him i would take a quick look around and found that the selection there was quite excellent they had a wide range of machines a large number of face masks on display and other crap related items the last place i went to they had to constantly show me a mask or show me this or that like everything was hidden away it really helped to see the different kinds of masks as ben was quite busy he suggested to perhaps book a formal appointment to sit down and discuss my concerns i booked an appointment for the next day not expecting too much as i had already purchased my gear and just wanted a face mask as ben was booking me in he said that its not a problem he would be happy to provide service to me as eventually if things are good i would come back anyways this comment goes a very long way in my book as it shows that hes more then happy to help even though there may not be a sale at the end he mentioned that i should bring in all my equipment so he can take a look at things the next day i came in for my appointment again not expecting much and brought in all my gear he instantly recognized all my gear as i assume its pretty standard and began looking into my machine as he was going through options on the menu he was explaining each and every option which my last place did not ben recalibrated a few things and it was night and day when he asked me to give it a try with the new settings in particular he turned on per i think its called with a crap machine its basically a constant stream of air pushing into you so exhaling or breathing out proved to be a bit challenging per reduces the pressure when you exhale making it easier to breath out he explained that likely when i was asleep and trying to breath out the pressure from my nasal mask was too great and the air escaped through my mouth and once my mouth started hanging open with the pressure pushing out that i would then wake up he continued to go through all the settings of the machine explained the pros and cons of this machine is another one he also spent a great deal of time explaining how best to clean and maintain the machine something the last place didnt do for me when i first got the machine i was over whelmed at all the instructions the tube needs to be cleaned once a week the humidity chamber needs to use distilled water and cleaned once a month or so the nasal mask needs to be cleaned once a day etc etc it was pretty crazy but ben was very gracious to break it all down for me and make sense of things for me something that again my last place neglected to do he explained all the different types of face masks and said that while he would have no problem selling me a full face mask to perhaps go home and give it another try with the new settings again i was wowed as he basically spent an hour going over everything with me even though there was no sale the other place i went to spent a total of 30 minutes with me i walked in they sold me a machine checked me out and went through some basic settings and off i went dazed and confused even though i called them back they put me with some other consultant actually when speaking to both consultants neither of them suffered from sleep apnea so i have little confidence that they would know all the annoyances that may happen while using the crap machine ben not only works in the crap industry he is also a user so he had a lot of keen insight that the other people i dealt with failed to have the experience with ben was night and day going forward i would definitely recommend paying him a visit as i will be for all my crap needs thanks ben|1

just a little psa im new to the area and thought this was going to be store quickly decided not as i came to fill our pantry and nearly every dry food item that i would normally buy in bulk that would last for a year was either at their expiration date or 2 weeks from it just be very cautious when shopping at this location as it seems the products sit on the shelf for nearly their entire shelf life pretty disturbing there were also flies stuck on some of the cold food items cashier was rude because i wanted paper instead of plastic sorry for trying to make the planet a little better shop somewhere else|0

zero stars had to rent here because our car was being repaired at the body shop next door started out weak and got a whole lot worse upon initial contact the counter girl was in her office on her personal phone looked straight at me and kept on talking on the phone 5 10 minutes later she came out to begin the rental process thank goodness most of the paperwork was already done since this was an insurance claim loaner rental so got the car no walk around no vehicle check with the attendant like you get at most rental places i did my own walk around went back in and told the gal that the car was not super clean inside or out couple litle dings and scratches she said its ok i just drove that car dont worry about it ok i drove away just returned the car this morning different gal at the counter her name is kate co took the key to check fuel and mileage she came back in and said i have to charge you 200 to have the car detailed because there is pet hair everywhere we dont allow pets in our cars huh first of all my pets never rode in this car second of all their website says their cars are pet friendly yes there was some dog hair on the drivers floor mat from my shoes tracking it in not a big deal if this had been enterprise when i said no she said well i can make it 50 but it has to be detailed because the next person might have allergies huh to say i was mad is an understatement at least she let me have the car back to vacuum it myself i went to the car wash around the corner and used the free vacuum it took all of 5 minutes to completely remove all traces of dog hair before pics attached when i went back i told her that it took 5 minutes and it wasnt that bad how could she justify trying to charge me 200 dollars she started arguing and tried to tell me there was dog hair everywhere when i said so you want to argue with me she said no i want you to calm down thats a great way to de escalate an upset customer not finished the transaction in silence and walked out i immediately told the folks next door at the body shop who couldnt believe it either they told me they have had lots of complaints about this hertz office they also said the just got enterprise on the other side of the parking lot my suggestion to them was and is get rid of hertz and move enterprise into their office the service advisor will be taking this complaint to his upper management hopefully hertz will lose this location they cant continue to treat customers like this and expect to remain in business isnt part of the reason you pay exorbitant rates to rent a car is because they have staff that clean their cars between rentals yes vacuuming should be part of that i will never rent from hertz again i will tell everyone i know to never rent from hertz no concept of customer service after reading some of these other reviews it seems like this hertz office doesnt know how to take care of their cars or their customers stay away from this location and stay away from hertz this is obvious y a company culture issue as well as just plain bad service i have called hertz corporate and related this experience i have also completed their online customer satisfaction survey rating them extreme y low needless to say this customer is not satisfied|0
i purchased a i idea 21 cu it portable washing machine from these folks yes its a little banged up but so what it was almost 12 price and it works wonderfully i got a great deal on a great machine it is much larger then i thought it would be i out that big cylinder that is in standard sized washers this one holds more clothing then i expected now i have a washing machine in my apartment what a convenience these folks are very friendly and were very helpful when i was picking out the washer they have a 2 week return policy so if if didnt work returning it would not have been a problem fyi the i idea and the magic chef washers are exactly the same machines the only difference was the name stamped on the only challenge i had was the plug for the drain water filter was not screwed in enough and water came out when i first tested it great product great people the next time i need an appliance i will be spending my hard earned at bargain central|1

we were so excited to be able to see the chinese lantern exhibit this past fall we had ordered our tickets in advance and were filled with anticipation parking was clearly marked easy to maneuver and close to the entrance of the exhibit signage clearly guided us to the correct entry for ticket holders and a quick scan got us in effortlessly the weather was delightful and we arrived at dusk so the lights of the lanterns were impressive a self guided event we were able to travel through at our leisure lingering as long as we liked at each display the sights the sounds the signage throughout were excellent a thoroughly enjoyable late afternoon and evening only piqued our interest in the garden and were determined to return to see more throughout the year|1
i have read the other reviews regarding came and agree absolutely with the review by the young female addict regarding the poor care and dismissive attitude my daughter was discharged rudely from drinking while on a pass even though she has alcohol dependence problems she was told to leave the hospital during the severe weather alert in early january after being without her medication for over 4 days and in slippers no possessions and a light jacket she suffers from severe bipolar and is prone to psychosis the treatment she received at came is absolutely the worst ive noted anywhere and is the antithesis of what came preaches|0
its very sorry that they cant utilise such nice location and space to be a more attractive shopping place i love italian cousins so much it is an art of cooking but also food for a healthy family seafood depot has lots of frozen food and less attractive fresh seafood besides too many non food items for who they could be eat aly or more sophisticate italian food collection place with more live seafood if its possible how about simply ask each customer what they want to buy there i drove a half hour supposed to buy snow crab legs for japanese hot pot but changed idea cause fresh lobster at another chinese mart is more reasonable however i bought a bottle of white balsamic vinegar that i could not find nearby supermarket|0
amy jordan knocked it out of the park for our engagement and wedding photos we could not have been happier with them and the way they captured this amazing time in our lives we live in durango co and were getting married in scottsdale so i used yelp to find photographers in the area and set up some skype chats with a few of them amy jordan were the first photographers we interviewed and after sky ping with them and reviewing their web site we knew they would be perfect for us and didnt bother interviewing anyone else during our initial skype chat with them they showed us numerous examples of their work and walked us through the online platform they use for sharing photos they seemed very organized and professional and also outgoing and enthusiastic before our wedding we traveled down to scottsdale to secure vendors for our wedding and take our engagement photos on the day we were to take our photos neither my fiancee or i were in the mood to take engagement photos on the way to meet amy jordan we both said we would meet them tell them we werent in the best mood didnt want to take any pictures and call it a day but as soon as we met amy jordan in person their energy and enthusiasm just swept us away and we ended up taking photos for 15 hours i was amazed at how much fun it ended up being and how they totally turned our mood around and made that time so special ive never experienced a photo shoot with professional photographers and was nervous about getting my picture taken but they made the process so intimidating and we felt instantly relaxed with having them photograph us we ended up getting some absolutely beautiful engagement photos that i will always treasure the day of the wedding they again impressed me with their positive energy enthusiasm and their ability to just jump in and do their thing while making everyone feel relaxed and comfortable they were punctual organized and again i can not stress enough so positive and enthusiastic even when it started to drizzle right before our ceremony started they were prepared with weather gear for their equipment and the show went on without a hitch the photos they took of that day are absolutely stunning and completely capture all the special moments we could not be happier with their work and would highly recommend them these two are just lovely people inside and out and we hope to keep in touch with them for our family photography needs in the future|1

this place sucks the only reason i even gave one star is because you have to give something i would prefer 5 stars it used to be much better with the old management and staff however theres all new management and the place has gone totally down hill this used to be one of the better budget suits because of the strip location however now its no different than the one on boulder highway two rooms are overpriced and disgusting the grounds are disgusting and i wouldnt dare go into that ses pool also stay away from the ord floor unless you want to live with pigeons and pigeon crap see pics i would recommend westwood suites because this place is going to total you have been warned|0
if i could give zero stars for my experience i would i came last night at 1225 am and waited at the drive thru for about 5 minutes then circled the place to find that one of the workers was in the lobby on his phone with his headset on the table i then went to the drive thru once again having to knock on both window one and two but no answer circled one more time to see a line form and i had to get out of my car and knock on the lobby window for him to stare at me do your job dont give me an excuse like you didnt realize it was turned off when you saw my car circling the place i came to find that there was actually two workers there and he said you were waiting for a long time huh and didnt even apologize left this place at 1245|0

this place has a great vibe and fun atmosphere the bartender kyle was great and didnt look flustered once but it was under staffed for the volume for happy hour the owner an older gentleman who wandered around the bar like a lost puppy never assisted the staff with anything he stopped and talked to a few pretty girls while he ignored my credit card that was desperately sticking out of the check presenter for over a half an hour i will come back just not when its busy|1
decent place near pittsburgh to pull in for the night pet friendly and lots of grass to walk the doggie no issues a little pricey based on location actually the room price was fine but the pet fee of 20 was a bit much super 8 may be pet friendly but at a high price these days it should be 10 max seriously total for room with tax was 6839 plus pet fee|1

like the previous commenter i only decided to try this place because i got a gift card i asked for a simple trim while wanting to keep the same style i had for my hair and bangs however once tom started cutting my hair i knew it wasnt going to turn out so well he was cutting large chunks of my hair completely straight wise that in the end my hair looked like it had been cut by a 12 year old same went with my bangs which were sticking out all over the place he could tell i was obviously unhappy with the end result so he stood me up in the middle of the salon and tried to do some damage control everything he did was not working out and he had me standing up for over 5 minutes while he cut mousse i hair sprayed blow dried some more finally i just didnt want him to mess up my hair any more so i had him stop all the madness and left now i need to go back to my regular salon to fix this mess the fact that he charges 65 for a haircut when he obviously doesnt know the basics of cutting hair is ridiculous|0
ok so i am now in all fairness updating my previous post after talking to the owner he said that they will ship the toddler rails and bed rails to my new place in california for free we have also been refunded the price of the rails the reason i am giving them 4 stars is that why they did not do this before why did it take the owner 4 months to call us and handle the issue i am very appreciative that they did and this is why i choose to shop at locally owned stores|1

the stucco work that was done was done well however there was one issue they bent the water hose pipe coming from the wall of the house then just bent it back into place however this caused a water leak behind the wall i contacted the supervisor about the damage and he came to take a look he said he had to contact the owner and would call me back several days later he called me back and said that they could not cover the damage and that i should call the owner side note the supervisor was a nice guy when i called the owner he acted like a 6 year old boy not a business owner you would simply just say that they did not do it and accused me of damaging my own home restated that they did not do it and hung up on me what i would have to gain from this i dont know because all i was asking was for the damage to be repaired so i had to have the pipe fixed at 15000 found out they are not registered with the bob either with business practices and ethics that the owner of this company has i would highly recommend never to use this company for anything i found them thru the to fix it website i doubt i will use them either consumer be ware and dont have a situation like mine|0

oh i ahah ga wed you gotta check this place out trust me you will not regret it i am married to a bosnian woman and have had my fair share of bosnian food cooked by her and her family and let me tell you that this place is totally legit i thought that my father in law made the best ce papi almost like a skinless sausage that is more minced beef than anything but this place totally gives him a run for his money the owner is very polite and always makes us feel like we are at home so if you werent already convinced to give this place a try you should definetly come over to the other side of the building to their bosnian grocery store if you are looking for anything balkan they most likely have it here at some point anything from spices to meat and to candies if you are looking for something to try that is not really your typical burger place mexican place or italian place that are on every corner then totally come and check out bona market|1
i am very disappointed at the service i have received from my doctor i have been a patient for many years the last appointment i had was rescheduled because she could not make it in that day no explanation other than we had to reschedule 30 minutes before my appointment today i thought my appointment was 15 min later than it actually was and i was told that i had to reschedule there was no one in the waiting room and only one person came in after me and he was there to schedule so i have changed doctors and hope to have a better experience next time the funny thing is if i had been on time i probably would have been sitting in the waiting room for 20 minutes like all the other times i have been there|0

i had lunch at dru xy i dru xy i college park at 777 bay it toronto on and asked if they had roast beef beef server said yes so i ordered the medium size on rye with a small milk for 13 i noticed that the meat had no texture and was cured very salty i asked the manager if this was roast beef and he said it was roast beef i said it tastes like a cured meat of some kind in an arrogant retort he said that roast beef is very salty i am no sandwich connoisseur but i regularly eat roast beef sandwiches from restaurants including other dru xy i locations this is not roast beef likely scenario they didnt have any roast beef so to avoid losing potential sales they give customers cure salt beef and assume they wont complain|0

driving down matheson i noticed a small plaza which caught my attention and decided to stop for friday lunch at pita lite entering the restaurant you immediately notice it is clean with easy to read menus they had a falafel wrap special that day however since im more of a fan of plates than wraps i decided to order the chicken shawarma plate the plate came with rice potatoes greek salad and of course some chicken shawarma service was great and before i know it i had a nice large meal sitting before my eyes i must say that the food was very tasty and you can tell everything was fresh the salad was full of flavour and the dressing made it even tastier the rice was cooked perfectly and the potatoes were a nice touch the chicken shawarma had great flavour and worked very well with the sauces they added however lacked that little bit of crispin ess to it that i think is needed for chicken shawarma overall my experience at pita lite was a positive one and i will be coming back in the future to try the rest of the menu|1

update i picked up my bike after paying 69 for a tune up some notes i asked that the chain be cleaned i asked if they could give the bike a quick wipe down i noted that the front derailer was in bad need of an adjustment upon pick up the chain was covered in grease the derailer wasnt adjusted or if it was it wasnt adjusted properly no road test how the hell can these guys test their workmanship without road testing the bike after a tune up holy so i rode my bike home from the store i ran the gears up and down both front and rear sets the chain skipped and fell off the front 4 times in a 3 am ride each time requiring a greasy mess to replace it took the bike back to the store the next day thankfully they didnt argue but told me the work was done by a bad mechanic who was no longer with them ok so knowing that the bike was tuned up by the bad mechanic i would have thought they would have rechecked this guys work before returning my bike this place is a total shit show go anywhere but here|0

this drug store has the most rude people working in the pharmacy my wife was there this evening to get a prescription filled for her niece who just had surgery the website said the pharmacy was open till 10 am she arrived a few minutes before 9 and was told the pharmacy closes at 9 and they would not fill it fortunately the manager intervened and the prescription was filled but when the manager asked the pharmacist to fill the prescription the blond woman working in pharmacy screamed at my wife and was very rude and abusive a person like that should not be in a position dealing with the public|0
over the course of three years i lived in two units both third floor because i liked the vaulted ceilings and the security of being able to leave my windows and patio door open with no worries i recommend if possible getting a unit that faces south and overlooks mountain vista park beautiful views quiet for the most part nice breezes the nitty gritty oh where to start first the pluses great location walking distance to bashes fresh and easy target amc ahwatukee theaters native new yorker the ahwatukee lakes golf course and plenty of bars restaurants and shops its also a short bike ride to trails along the foothills of south mountain the apartments inside are clean and nice the top floor apartments are especially nice with vaulted ceilings in the living room some of them even have open floor plans connecting the living room kitchen dining room the views from both third floor apartments varied big sky and mountains in the distance which was always welcome while being out on the patio and if you have a place over the park you dont ever have to look at neighbors there is occasionally a rent a security person walking around on weekend nights and sometimes during the week as well but they are not proactive unless you call in to complain theyre happy to let a holes crank rap music at am let peoples stupid dogs bark incessantly and that will now ease us into the negatives the ac in both my top floor apartment was mostly pathetic huge and built into the ceiling and completely inefficient may be the non roof floors have better ac and it leaked condensation when i used it at one unit they tried to fix it but eventually i ended up just putting a couple buckets in the hallway i used it as little as possible because it cost a fortune to run and never got the place cool enough the parking spaces are tiny tiny best hope you dont have a space next to a truck or suv and theres barely any guest parking its also a bitch finding a place to park a moving truck depending on what building you are in it was ridiculous how far along the lot from the stairs that i had to park my haul for the first unit i was in if you have kids you will love the west section of presidio your untended kids of all ages can run rampant all over the complex seriously between up and nightfall the screaming and yelling is insane the kids have this one game that i call scream bloody murder they just run around shrieking as if they were being chased by an a i murderer then theres the dogs actually its more a problem of people who shouldnt own dogs and dont give an i about anybody else theyre happy to let their dogs bark for over an hour straight theyre happy to leave their poor dogs out on their balcony all day long or all night long and since the balconies are three feet high the dogs cant see over the top and they bark at everything not only will nobody do anything to stop them but one time i called to complain then minutes later some gang banger was out yelling searching for who called on them if you smoke weed youll love this place i dont smoke it but its nontoxic and ill take that any day over the damn cigarette smokers if you do nobody will say anything even if you happen to be on a patio right next to the leasing office lease renewal a few months before your lease is up youll get a letter offering to allow you to renew your lease at an increase of a mere 5070 or so extra a month dont do that put in your official notice that you are moving out and then they will be more than happy to ask you to stay with your rent the same as it was and even offer you 100 off your renewed leases first month that was my experience anyways overall if your e in a good location at the presidio you can be pretty happy here if you dont want to listen to kids get a place facing south along the park|0

walked in about 1130pm on a sat night there was about 2 groups of people and another couple the waitress took our drink order and then another waiter came out with a vegetable and dressing appetizer i really liked the porcelain chopstick stands the menu has pictures to go along with everything and there were 2 separate ordering sheets for sushi and yakitori they also have a unique drink menu as usual we always over order for two people but thats what you do when its your first time spicy tuna roll nothing special not sure well ordered sushi next time wagyu beef skewers daily special freakin amazing each skewer had 4 pieces of beef pork belly and cabbage sit i fry this was a great dish and it also had some sort of sauce or broth in the bottom so stir it up shrimp with spicy mayo shrimps were a good size 3 pieces but nothing stands out so ki soba hot soba no do les soup with 1 pork spare rib in pork fat broth yummy corn good with some type of sauce on it 2 pieces it took about 15 mins for 1 dish to come out but once one came out everything else followed you might wanna to specify the order you want it to come out in because we got our corn last and the soup towards the end of the meal not really a problem just weird all the dishes came out extremely hot so it was freshly delivered from the grill to our table we agree with misty y we like not having to order off the things written on the wall like ichi za i always feel like im missing out when i go there because there is so much the atmosphere is also a lot less quieter than ichi za we have yet to go to raku the prices were reasonable our total bill was 4070|1

i purchased laminate flooring for a hallway stairs and one room for our home on november with once that arrived on december hard we decided to purchase more padding and flooring for two additional rooms a week ago i called all to inform them that our home had some beautiful hardwood flooring that we refurbished since it was under the carpet and the flooring purchased is going to one of our rentals so we are not going to return the flooring i only wanted to return the rolls of padding and stair planks we are not going to use i was told it was over 30 days and they would not refund or allow any kind of returns in person they are very nice now once you order you can forget about it it will be delivered late and they do that on purpose so they can hold on to their 30 day policy people be smart do not deal with them|0
please read it all this is a 8500 mistake for the year i put down a hold fee for a particular apartment 7 weeks in advance and i was promised that the carpet stains would be removed and the apartment will be move in ready by june with 2017 practically two months go by and the signing day of my lease june with 2017 i walk into the apartment to view it before i sign the lease absolutely nothing was done the stains were still in the carpet the only solution they had was to find another apartment or wait another week so that they can remove the carpet so considering the fact that i had to be out of my current apartment by july est i did not have a week to wait i took my chances and tried to find another apartment my leasing agent tamika kent showed me an apartment that had just became vacant this same day nothing was done in this apartment either but shockingly it looked better than the one i had a hold fee on for the past 2 months i took the apartment with the leading impression from tamika kent that i would get at least a 100 discount on my first month rent due to the circumstances and considering that none of this was my fault extremely inconveniencing but instead her boss becky said all she can do is give me my 35 application fee back in conclusion i beg you all to not trust timber top timberland village apartments the management will lie the maintenance will lie and so will the leasing agents after all the maintenance men are old and lazy and extremely short staffed the management although new are people who do not like to admit they are wrong and sleep perfectly fine weather you are a happy customer or not the leasing agents are also lazy and work off of commission so at the end of the day all they want you to do is sign the paper and they will feed you false hopes and dreams even when they know the situation will leave you fucked over in the end please give someone else your money and do not waste your time|0
buyer beware i very seldom post reviews online but after getting taken for 500 by tom mccreary i feel obligated to save other unsuspecting customers from the same fate he sold me a used heat pump which my handyman went to pick up driving over an hour one way to do so tom assured him that it works fine and had been replaced due to a remodel my ac company went out to install the unit and informed me that it not only had no freon in it but that it had tar in it from where the last of the freon had burnt tom mccreary had never mentioned anything about a freon leak and no freon in the unit the fix was going to cost me 1200 plus the service call when my handyman called him to tell him this tom hung up on him the only honest thing that tom said is that there was no warranty of any kind which of course should have been a huge red flag right there but i figured an ac contractor would care enough about his reputation to not rip people off sadly that was not the case learn from my loss and deal with reputable people not this guy and adding insult to injury my tenant is still without heat|0

we were in the process of selling our house had thought there may be a problem with the roof we called diversified roofing and were told that just a little maintenance was needed and were quoted a price of 750 after 2 employees spent 2 hours on our roof they were finished our house went under contact shortly there after and was inspected by the buyers this is a quote from the inspector a repair has been made recently which could account for some of the water damage it appears it will work although not exactly a thing of beauty the inspector took pictures of the roof showing black tar spread over several areas of the roof because of this i had to lower the agreed upon price to sell my house by more than ten thousand dollars i complained to diversified roofing and they sent their customer service manager kelly out to inspect the roof and didnt even go up on the roof to look after our conversation i was told that the black tar was not done by them even though no one has been on the roof in the 9 years i have owned the house i was told i was expected to pay the 750 or they would put a lien on my house|0
words can not describe i was the first and only customer in there to say the woman behind the counter provided poor customer service would be an incredible understatement im sure something terrible must have happened to her today to make her in such a bad mood but the way i was talked to was worse than ive been treated since i can remember everything she said was so incredibly rude and everything was with so much attitude she was also so slow moving like i said i was the first and only customer when i got there and it took me over 30 minutes to get out of there 10 minutes of which was waiting at the till for her to tell me my total i ordered 2 6 inch combos with fountain pops and cookies for both and i thought each combo came with 2 cookies for a total of 4 cookies with 2 combos she informed me that despite what the menu said each combo only came with 1 cookie so i said okay cancel the 2 other cookies then i just want whatever comes with 2 combos and then she couldnt get the machine to take off my initial order i guess and she snapped at me look at what you did the computers not working its all your fault i look online later and it does say each combo comes with 2 cookies not 1 so i am so confused she also got mad actually angry at me and made me feel so stupid when i ordered white chocolate macadamia nut cookies because she told me i need to clarify weather its chocolate or regular well if it was chocolate i wanted i would have added in the word chocolate but that was her reaction to everything when i ordered flat bread she yelled literally yelled you need to tell me white or multigrain like i said it took me over 10 minutes with her standing at the computer trying to punch in my order i was watching my phone timing her at this point before i was able to pay and leave i still am just in shock i have never been actually yelled at by somebody in long time let alone somebody at a restaurant whether its fast food or not i dont expect great customer service at a fast food place but honestly to be not yelled at and treated like a human being would be just perfect for me i came in sunday january 15 just before up left after 930pm and i would love some follow up from management about that woman i tried looking for a name tag but she wasnt even wearing one she is the older black lady i always go to subway but will never go to that location simply because i do not want to be treated like how she treated me ever again|0

do not go here we came in a week before christmas because our new kitten had a uti and we need to get him treated the vet took him back to get an exam and then proceeded to tell us that he would need to stay the night for a couple days and then after that would need to have a surgery to turn him into a female because he wasnt going to develop male parts and if not he would most likely die this came with a 2400 quote tears were shed and we were in shock at there recommendations completely distraught we asked what the other option was 1300 and a 3 night stay with a catheter in muscle relaxers that made a little more sense but still severe in the end i didnt trust them and just we took him home with a 300 bill fed him unitary support food and muscle relaxer all went well and the dude is 3 months old and super healthy what i dont get about veterinarians is the discrepancy from some insane possibility to just letting us take him home which is it seems like they just wanted to take everything we had based on our new kittens certain death i remember having this problem with my pups at alta vista clinic please tell me theres a good honest vet in phoenix|0

one of my coworkers suggested the urban tea loft as a cozy restaurant that would be a perfect date place and said the food was excellent i thought id give it a try since the website looked great and the online menu left my mouth watering unfortunately we were very disappointed location check restaurant interior check ambiance check service sucks i would never go back again it took an hour to get a side salad with the entrees that never came the appetizers never showed up after waiting an hour after ordering servers were walking around without a clue as to which table food went to they came back to the table next to us a half hour after they ordered the food and told the girl that they were out of the one dish it took them a half hour to figure that out never got a refill on my ice tea which was amazing after i drank it up in ten minutes it was 91 degrees outside and i was thirsty i ended up throwing a 10 on the table and left i thought an hour and 45 minutes was plenty of time to eat before seeing joan rivers at the chandler center of the arts not at this place make sure you give yourself three hours and go on off hours when theres only one customer in the place because the wait staff can only deal with 1 table per server i ended up going to jack in the box because i was running short on time and received far stellar service then at urban thanks tea loft for ruining date night almost joan rivers rocked it at the chandler center for the arts short story food looks good wish i could have tried it but didnt have three hours to spend waiting around while the servers figured it out|0

i really wish i had the same experience as everyone else all the reviews sound so positive i did my course with my girlfriend about a month ago i was really looking forward to it but unfortunately it was just a horrible experience sol the main guy who was teaching was awful he was condescending arrogant and downright rude from the moment he spoke the entire thing was rushed and not planned well at all there was no communication between the 2 teachers it was almost like they had met for the first time and not discussed anything before start of class it was really unfortunate because all the participants in the course were really nice fun people this was my birthday gift from my girlfriend it was supposed to be fun but instead it was stressful and frustrating because of how rushed and unorganized everything was in the water we werent given an explanation of what we were doing beforehand we were just expected to know it and then do it its hard to know what to do when its your first time diving and you are underwater trying to understand hand signals a simple explanation before each skill exercise would have made things go faster and smoothly instead of wasting time trying to understand what we are doing luckily i was in the other instructors group and he was actually a decent guy i heard horror stories from sols group from lack of safety to kicking someone out of the water because they werent progressing fast enough bottom line check to see who your teacher will be before you register it sounds like there are good teachers there just make sure its not sol i honestly dont even know why the guy teaches hes miserable and clearly doesnt like people this whole experience has made me question whether or not i want to be a diver good luck all|0

i really wanted to like this place born and raised in the country of no i grew up on good biq i will say the biq itself is good negatives portions are small no hush puppies on the menu that is a southern staple at a biq joint i would also recommend adding french fries service was horribly slow and there were two tables seated that night our server had no idea about the menu i asked him a question about a side and he looked at the menu himself to see also when i asked about beers be there is no list of beers all i got was sycamore beers not being from charlotte i had no idea what sycamore beers are i can give them the benefit of the doubt being new however being new i would expect the service to be top notch this place needs major work to keep them open may be just stick to being a food truck|0

i loved pretty much everything about my workout here at otf it took me ages to sign up and i found that it was not as intimidating as i had imagined otf took the thinking out of working out for me i am told what to do when and how to do it kim who was my trainer spent time going over the equipment the process and made sure she had me take time to cool off when i was going past my abilities and i especially loved the monitors i could see real time the fruits of my labor i can not only feel but also see how these pushes equated to heart rate and calorie burn and the workout rotations actually made the time go faster you work out at your own pace and fitness level and get a really good workout and i am really motivated by seeing tangible results at the end of the session its not just about weight loss its about building a healthy lifestyle and endurance and i just absolutely love it|1

there was no music on the night that we went so i have no idea what this place is like as a bar i am in calgary on business and just wanted a place that was decent we came based on yelp reviews and was horribly disappointed from the moment we walked in i should have known it was going to be bad while it was decently busy for being a bit early for dinner wish it took several minutes to catch the waitresses attention to ask if we could sit wherever when she came to the table she only brought one menu for two people apologized for it but then never came back with a and menu when she brought the appetizer fried pickles they were good she again brought only a single plate there were two of us i ordered the mac cheese and my coworker ordered the jambalaya the mac cheese was not very cheesy at all and whatever sausage they used was most definitely not andouille his jambalaya was pretty sad the rice was way overcooked and just in a tomato sauce there was no cajun seasoning at all i dont know what kind of meats were supposed to be in it but it was pretty fishy our waitress stopped by while eating to let us know she was going off shift and needed to check us out when she came back with the credit card machine she brought her car keys but not a pen to sign the receipt i genuinely dont understand the good reviews on the food here it definitely looks like it might be a good place for drinks and music but do not eat here updated 04252014 both of us ended up getting sick from the food|0
as others have said you come here for the view not the food the inside of the restaurant is beautiful with classy decor we got seated right in front of one of the huge windows with a gorgeous view if north side and the point so it was worth it it was beautiful to watch the sun set and the lights come on in the city that being said the food was mediocre at best we got one of each of the main entrees as a part of the spring summer dinner menu and each one was underwhelming i wouldnt recommend any of them furthermore the service was also not great the servers kept trying to clear away plates we were still working on they would bring on the next course before everyone was finished with the previous one we got the distinct impression that they were just trying to hurry us out of there if you come here come prepared to enjoy the view and the decor of the restaurant but not much else|0

who would think id get fantastic fish chips at a burger joint but i did i took a chance since i wasnt in the mood for a burger like the rest of my party and im glad i did delicious crisp perfectly fried coating and thick white fish pieces no fishy taste whatsoever very fresh tasting im impressed this will be my choice from now on everyone was satisfied with their burgers and grilled chicken salad as well the fries were lukewarm and limp but that fish made them tolerable our waitress was very courteous and efficient very nice girl now the reason i didnt give five stars the hostess without the most ess terrible personality not friendly and welcoming as a hostess should be we almost turned around and walked out i tried being friendly and she just glared at us you know her the miserable one with the strawberry blond hair yeah you need to lose her or lose customers other that her great experience and great food apps are very overpriced but well be back for the fish and burgers|1

i have been living for a year at 10 grenoble do and can not wait to move to another apartment nothing about this building is ok the janitors shelly and her brother terry absolutely do nothing for anybody and they just want to charge you for nothing we have problem with heating system that keeps making terrible noise already told them several times and even the manger roaches are everywhere in the refrigerator sink bath although we have used all kind of chemical we can not get rid of them as the whole building is old and dirty also we have seen mice around neighbors are terrible just leave anything for a second in the corridor to be vanished by these thieves they throw garbage everywhere and they dont respect others rights i definitely not suggest this hell for living|0
ive lived in vegas for a little over a year now and ive found there are no shortage of restaurants in business centers off of the strip i stumbled upon chef rings while running errands with a friend the inside is cozy and well lit a lot of ambient lighting makes it pleasant to dine with a view of the world outside you can see the kitchen and see the food being prepared which for a small restaurant is important to me because i can see the cook at all times and smell the fresh aromas as the wok is working the restrooms are clean which is rare and a huge plus the food came up fast and i ordered chicken chow me in the noodles were perfect not too oily but flavorful the portion size was generous and i was given complimentary pot stickers and egg flower soup even though the pot stickers were probably because i was a dine in guest for the first week of opening the meal was cheap 595 for lunch and had extras to take to go overall the food quality and flavor was better than average but the thing that really made my experience great was the service the manager or owner didnt bother to ask may was very pleasant and visited my table twice to ask if there was anything she could bring me and how my meal was in my experience service is one of the lacking elements in a lot of small fast chinese restaurants the only thing that i would note is their menu seemed slightly limited but i was told that over time they would be expanding it they also deliver which is a plus even though i live too far to make use of this a really great gem of a restaurant perfect for anyone seeking quick food good portions a value for the money and friendly attentive service|1

ive been living here for the past year i live in one of the older models in the back i was attracted to this place because it is close to my school and fairly cheap this place is ok they have bug problems everyone here smokes so get used to the pot smell there is a lot of random arguments in the middle of the night gunshots some times but honestly things could be a lot worse the office team is full of really nice and well spoken people usually your maintenance request gets followed up in a couple days and most of the people here are pleasant the pool is disgusting do not go in and it closes very quickly after opening the shared stairs and little hallways are gross the dumpsters are always covered with trash and in the summer the bug problem does get to be out of control but if your e poor like me it is a decent spot no one is going to bother you or anything|0

if i could rate it lower than 1 star i would i still live here at 291 and can say that the last posters comments are right on the money this place is a dump the superintendent of the place has an iq of 20 if that and the place is falling apart elevators break on a weekly basis stinks like garbage in the laundry room the list goes on and on worst of all the manager is rude and very abrasive when it comes time to complain about issues in the building stay far away from this place|0
i agree with previous reviews the service at this location has gone downhill avoid this dealership if you need service better yet choose a dealership that treats you well not only at the point of sale but after the sale i have been a client since 2012 and had to recently start using a new dealership in a neighboring city for service ive waited a week just to get someone to call me back so i could book an appointment 90 of their calls go to an answering machine and they dont return calls unless you call repeatedly and servicing that has been completely downhill|0
excellent place very good strains it has what you need good variety once they have edibles it will be much better like the rest of the dispensaries staff is very friendly a little hidden spot|1
tried it again will not be back took my brother sister in law to this restaurant for a birthday lunch we arrived at 1130 and did not get our lunch until well after noon both of my family members had to get back to work the server never refilled our ice tea and never checked on the table while we were eating on the patio they started painting right next to our table i did not write a review at the time early feb and i went back last night before making my decision silverware was dirty but the service was much better i told our waitress about the previous experience and she listened politely but did not take my name or number or notes as i asked to have the information given to the manager food is just ok and with so many restaurants to chose from in the scottsdale area this place is now off the list of four local residents|0
first tried mim is when we first started coming to scottsdale about 6 years ago it was always a go to place where we could get good food at a decent price dont know whats happened but weve been to 3 different locations this trip and the food has really gone downhill sauces are gummy and cooked to death with too much flour cornstarch had the crab cake appetizers most recently and neither crab or cake belong in the description the crab was nonexistent and they were the size of a 3 inch pancake the other annoying thing is that the servers now try to push whatever special is going in like the wine thing or the add a soup or salad thing so sorry we wont be going to any mim is anytime soon|0
terrible service firstly waited to be greeted was met with zero friendliness nor apology from waitress waited way too long for our beverage refills waited way too long for our check messed up on my order twice but did not say anything the second go around because i gave up and ate it anyway syrup tasted stale just off and as the other reviews stated why is it so cold inside my coffee was cold within minutes go to steves for a prompt warm tasty breakfast|0
i had the wonderful opportunity to purchase one of your pretzels for 8 at the acc while i usually enjoy a warm soft pretzel with a zesty mustard this one was unique it takes a brave restaurant to serve a cold pretzel an even braver one to serve one that is also stale hard as a rock actually or as a foodie might say naturally air dried of course the coup de grace for any 8 pretzel is the mustard and the french i yellow was a nice touch the industrialized flavours truly amplified the air dried texture bravo|0

first the repair shop here is really really busy by the numbered tags on each unit the service department is overwhelmed however being busy is a consequence of location revs need service in the fall in a snowbird destination busy is not an excuse for rudeness we didnt sell you your trailer so your current problem with it is not our problem we are not bumping other customers for you when i asked for a 10 minute evaluation of how long it would take to repair the problem we had to get the factory warranty people involved to get help including help with a potential road hazard trailer repaired but the female warranty representative who doesnt much like us claimed to not have a business card and directly refused to give us her last name that alone speaks volumes for customer care we are thankful for the intervening factory representatives|0
we are new to the neighborhood busy unpacking our new house and not in the mood to cook we placed our order online but noticed that since our house was so new the exact location was not correct i contacted the store right away to inform them of this there was some miscommunication at first we were originally told that if our address was not pulling up that they would not deliver to us when i asked to speak to the manger terri got on the phone to make things right she took down the directions and had the pizza out to us in no time the driver deliver gentleman was very professional and apologetic about the original miscommunication i would recommend this papa johns location and would order from them again thanks|1
first off i dont get the reviews that imply the staff is rude everyone went out of their way to be nice to me next it is hard to get through on the phone i ended up placing my order in person and waiting i ordered a stuffed pizza which takes longer and even on friday it was only 25 or so minutes as for the pizza its just good im admittedly no foodie but i liked it and will be back time and again i recommend|1
i absolutely love the ballroom i have been here multiple times for shows and its always a good time it has a very intimate feel to it almost like im in someones oversize living room the staff is super friendly and efficient i just wish the stage was a little higher somehow it can be very difficult to see sometimes|1
two days in a row i have stopped her to get coffee and there was not one coffee pot with anything in it there were actually people waiting for someone in the store to stop talking and make coffee now this is between 830am and 9 am you know when people are going to work and need coffee so i decided to call circle i and complain first i got a machine that did not even give enough time to leave a message si i called back and got a receptionist who transferred me to another machine now i understand why the store is in off i cant i apparently thats how the company is run done with circle i they have no idea of the concept of convenience store|0

brought in a bridesmaid skirt to have it taken in a couple inches but needed it within the week for the wedding the ladies assured me it was enough time and i left it in their hands when i went back to pick it up it had clearly not been altered and was visibly still way too large they insisted the work was completed and as i was in a rush i paid them and left which in hindsight was incredibly stupid fast forward to the wedding day and it turns out my skirt was not altered and is hanging off me thank god for safety pins because we had to my gui ver that skirt into place and pray it stayed put i brought the skirt back after the wedding to ask for my money back i didnt get the service i shouldnt have to pay it and they flat out refused to even admit they did anything wrong not only did they not feel like providing a refund but they insisted the work had been done even after i put the skirt on and showed them that it was still way too big i blame myself for being too trusting but want to warn others that this place is a disaster shitty work and no accountability|0
although my remaining extractions were the easiest ever the thousands we spent were a complete waste although they have good marketing and we saved to make this my reality and since it has been a nightmare not only a horrible fit that caused numerous mouth sores and scaring the teeth jetted out i was told 20 is natural not if it doesnt match my gum line after months and months and numerous visits we were told we wanted something for nothing ummm i noooo just what we paid for finally they agreed to redo and in the interim did an alignment at last relief from pain got the new set and although it now was a match to my mouth and looked natural but the mouth sores began again each visit was met with the same lecture and often double teamed it was beyond exasperating constantly told what i was doing wrong and my concerns fell on deaf ears after 10 months of total frustration the doctor accused me of recording him i shouldve so he could hear himself talk over me i demanded they do an a line ment they did the bottom and didnt smooth it out and being after hours i called it a day i sent a message it was exactly what i needed and needed to do the top and smooth out bottom no response receptionist even sent a reminder and the do still did not respond today numerous mouth sores and new scaring would have rather gotten 5 affordable denture sets than the anguish ive been through with global update my husband used a tool from his bowling equipment and fixed the upper no more sores but the bottom they had butchered so he couldnt do anything with it|0
the staff here are horrible we visited to ascertain if we wanted to move in submitted an application which we were told there was a promotion and it was no charge however we decided not to move in didnt sign any lease or intent to move in 2 months later get a credit collection notice that we owe 300 for application fees with do not move in they are fraud|0

i used to like reggie i and was a regular customer but have found the quality to really become erratic recently which is a shame on its good days the best items to try are their comfort foods and breakfasts all day first when pulling in beware as the parking lot is very rough with major pot holes for your cars sake go slow one item that ive liked here is the old fashioned which is a couple potato pancakes served with sour cream and cheese couple eggs breakfast meat and toast another few that ive liked are their ruben their philly cheese steak their ciabatta club sandwich the hot roast beef sandwich served open face and their chicken enchilada soup spicy also on the weekends in the morning they have a breakfast bar a buffet of typical breakfast items including eggs sausage bacon potatoes pancakes waffles corned beef hash and an assortment of fruit their ny strip steaks seem to be very hit or miss ive gotten some excellent steaks cooked quite well before but have also gotten a number that felt like half gristle it felt like about a 30 chance of getting a bad steak talking more of the erratic quality an example one time when i ordered the ciabatta turkey club i got a sandwich with soggy ciabatta bread and raw bacon not just undercooked it looked like it hadnt been cooked at all ive also gotten eggs burned at random times bacon burned hashbrowns burned etc again this is not a 100 thing but it is enough recently to make it not worth my while coming back anytime soon unfortunately|0
i cant believe that this vet is advertising holistic pet care i took my dog to this clinic for several years and thought that they were pretty good however they insisted on vaccinating every year if youve read anything about vaccinations you know that a holistic vet would not recommend that vaccination schedule we were actually forced into the vaccinations because we were told our animal could not be groomed there without the constant yearly vaccinations if you are looking for holistic vet care do not go to this clinic|0
dana lee really did a fantastic job with my hair you wont be disappointment amazing makeover on mine|1
this is not gourmet pizza by any stretch its regular mediocre pizza its greasy no thin crust no style i saw this place and thought wed try it out as we saw gourmet in the name and thought wed get something like stone pizza or queen margarita except closer to home i was pretty excited for a high quality pizza place in the area sadly its nothing special especially when its priced as if it is actually gourmet pizza seemed really expensive for what we got i expected something completely different the toppings were chunky and unrefined huge chunks of green peppers and mushrooms italian sausage tasted a bit funny no option for thin crust or easy cheese pepperoni was good and not too overwhelming but that should be expected at any pizza place sauce tasted like it came from a can not fresh no different than chain pizza places the pesto pizza again was nothing special there was nothing wrong with them if you just want a simple pizza they just were not worth the price we also got wings and garlic bread neither were very good wings were nicely well done but lacking flavour and the garlic bread was stale tasting and burnt hardly could taste any garlic at all sure they have a great deal of toppings options but theyre expensive prepared carelessly and just thrown on the pizza they have a lot of pizza options like gluten free and vegan but there was literally no other difference between this place and any other cheap pizza place along kingston except the price next time ill either take the time to go to queen margherita for actual gourmet quality or just get pizza nova which is better value too bad its so hard to find good and proper gourmet pizza in this area perhaps if they dropped the gourmet from the name and lowered prices to actually reflect the quality of the pizzas it would get a better rating from me but when you charge a lot and dont deliver on the promise of high quality that the word implies your e going to get some disappointed customers|0
i went in with terrible knee pain they took an xray and i saw the do yu for seriously two minutes which they billed my insurance for 452 for just the office visit he ordered an ultrasound to ensure i didnt have a blood clot which would be very serious they were to set up the ultrasound and call me this was on monday morning when i didnt hear back i called them on tuesday they still had not set up the ultrasound said they would get right back to me i finally heard from them on friday of that week ridiculous i could have had a blood clot luckily did not i called and complained but it went no where stay away and find a place that will do what they say and that really cares about their patients|0

i have lived in camden properties for more than two years until now i have had nothing but praise for camden management and the property i rent from them this year when it came time for my lease renewal i received the notice that my rent was increasing by 22 though polite in their response to my protest their answer was that i should be grateful it was only 22 and that they were cutting me a 90 break because i was a good tenant without my good tenant status my increase would have been more than 30 in the midst of a recession they claim market reasons for the increase if you plan on renting from camden plan on unpredictable rent increases a disregard to loyal no trouble tenants and a strict adherence to their bottom line|0

came here after finding out that it was brand new opened just 3 weeks ago we decided to come since we heard that it was one location with various things that we enjoy cocktails and drinks escape rooms and violence through axe throwing to be fair this is a review not on their escape rooms since we havent done the yet but we plan on going soon and then ill have to come back and change my review to fit it but today got there in the late afternoon there wasnt anyone really there yet since it was still early but the hostess was super nice she actually gave us a tour of the place the axe throwing room upstairs the escape room downstairs and the lounge area on the main floor the whole place is super cosy and really seems like just a nice little place to get some drinks after a long day of work so even without the axe throwing and the escape rooms im already quite impressed with the lounge area there are comfy sofas armchairs and chairs each table has a little game that you can play with your friends eg reloaded where you shock each other shoot the moon which we spent about an hour on where you try to roll the ball from one end to the other to get the highest points catch phrase youve probably seen this on some late night show before chess and other puzzle games the drinks are great strong and pretty reasonable in prices great little place for some drinks with friends chat and have some fun finally came back to try one of the escape rooms we did the asylum with 8 people the max number of people at first i was a little worried that we might not have enough to do cause we had so many of us there but they assured us that usually even with larger groups everyone will still find that theyre kept busy throughout the game before starting the hostess came up to us to explain the rules and then brought us to the room it was a little creepy and the story she told before us starting the room made it so much creepier the room itself was fun and challenging enough with enough puzzles that kept all of us more or less busy we finished the room waaaay ahead of time we ended up escaping in 32 minutes our group are a bit of escape room veterans so compared to other escape rooms weve done the puzzles are good the room was very well done props were good but its not as high tech as some other escape rooms majority are lock and boxes a couple of other cool interactive stuff in the end we all enjoyed it a lot it was a load of fun and were definitely gonna come back to do the other ones|1
i used to eat at congee wong frequently but one incident completely put me off and i have not returned i found 2 inch long slivers of metal in my wonton like ones that might come off a metal scouring pad for cleaning dishes i was shocked and almost cracked my teeth on it before spitting it out i took it up with the waitress and manager i even tried to be discreet so as not to embarass them in front of their other customers the waitress looked dumbfounded and thee manager said very loudly you found that in your wonton how did that get in there then began to laugh hysterically the waitress also started to laugh i said your e the manager this is your restaurant you tell me she put up her arms and shrugged and walked away from me still laughing no apology no explanation no offer to at least replace the food or remove it from my bill i paid every cent and did not tip i have never been back since and would not eat there again if it were the last restaurant left on earth in a related note if you search the health inspection website which oversees cleanliness in restaurants you will see that this congee wong has failed many times including once for failure to control rodents and having cross contamination of meat and vegetables rats in the kitchen and metal in my food never again|0
this place is wonderful went to celebrate my birthday and they were amazing service was wonderful and they even took a picture of us to remember the night they sent it to us via mail and it was a nice photo love the atmosphere of the place very cozy and warm food is excellent and the server was very knowledgeable about what they offered|1
i came here with a friend of mine today to get a full set of acrylics i booked an appointment for up a couple days ago just to make sure we would be able to get our nails done today service was horrible we were not greeted at all when we came in i told the lady at the front desk i made an appointment a few days ago and she just told me to sign in so we did we waited for an hour and twenty minutes nobody asked us if we have been helped yet or anything they all just stared at us until about a half hour before we were taken back to get our nails done a lady apologized for our wait we finally went back to get our nails done and i felt rushed leo did our nails and he sent off my friend before her nails were even fully dried so they ended up getting messed up on the car ride home my nails are a lot shorter than he cut them and they are super thick he was also super aggressive when filing my nails and moving my hand around i felt like he just wanted us out of there hours later now and my nails hurt so bad around the edges and if they continue to hurt im just going to get them taken off totally not worth the 70 just for my nails i will be going back to lavish beauty lounge in medina from now on|0
bunch of incompetent employees ordered on door dash and an hour later when the door dash runner arrives for pick up they tell him they are out of bread you would think the manager could have easily called door dash or myself upon receipt of the order to advise of such but he claims he was busy how busy could a sandwich shop with no bread be i guess he was too busy and overwhelmed to tell people im sorry we are out of bread and make a 20 second phone call in the span of an hour when i called to express my frustration the manager blatantly ignored me and claimed he was so busy it was too much to take my phone call as he was just trying to make it through the day poor kid what a tough job patiently awaiting his managers phone call as promised is there is a reason this location is less than the normal 4 stars all negative reviews regarding service|0
i swore id never go here again after repeatedly being treated like a leper or something may be my tattoos they had some pensioner running the show who for some reason wouldnt even hardly acknowledge my existence for at least the past 5 years i went elsewhere today i had no choice as i was in desperate need of a pool brush and everybody else was out and to my surprise two young ladies working polite and helpful brush bought pool saved thank you ladies cheers|1

wow what a terrible experience please read this if you are planning on buying an autograph from them piece of the past is an online autograph auction service that deals in classic and contemporary signatures as an avid autograph collector i have been looking for a site like this since the trustworthiness of ebay for autographs is murky at best i joined a few months ago and began bidding and buying items immediately my first purchase went very smoothly when i received my invoice i was in las vegas and saw that their storefront wasnt far away i contacted them and asked that to save time and shipping costs could i stop by and pay for it pick it up in person i spoke with a nice young man named matt and he handled my first transaction at the store very well for the next few months i purchased items in nearly every auction set they posted some weekly some biweekly i was spending hundred of dollars with them over time i have called them to discuss invoices and shipping arrangements and every time ive dealt with anyone except matt theyve been rude and abrasive i was somewhat put off by the treatment but still enjoyed the autographs i was acquiring so i let it go a few weeks ago i won an autographed photo and it arrived damaged all four corners were bent there were indentations small rips and a large crease down the left side it was entirely unacceptable the obvious reason for the damage was poor packing the cardboard inserted into the large envelope wasnt nearly big enough or strong enough for the photo i sent a very respectful and business like email requesting a new autograph if they had a duplicate or a refund credit on a future item one whole week went by without response and i found myself in las vegas again with autograph in hand so i could take it in and address my issues in person just a few hours before i was planning on taking the item into their storefront i received a very rude response from the ceo of the company kevin martin saying he wouldnt take responsibility and it was the post offices fault i called the store to further inquire about the rude email and the person on the phone began yelling at me i hung up and decided to wait until i get to the store and try to talk to matt within minutes i receive another email from kevin martin who i was told was out of town but seemed remarkably up to the minute in touch with the issue telling me that unless i give his employees a formal apology i will be blacklisted from his site at this point i am just floored a business is asking one of its loyal clients to apologize for something they arent responsible for i went to the storefront to find it locked although they were obviously open i knocked on the window and matt came out to talk to me i laid everything out and he very amicably resolved the situation i reminded him that ive already spend hundreds with his company and that in the future i would most likely be spending thousands of dollars more i also told him that at this time i am very upset with the way i was treated and would like to withdraw my current bids especially since kevin martin has blacklisted me at this point and frozen my upstanding account matt apologized for the issues and left things on somewhat good terms i decided that i would take some time then consider giving them my business again then approximately 10 minutes out from the store i receive another email from kevin martin who was obviously at the store the whole time criticizing me calling me rude and attacking me as a person having the straw that broke the camels back sent directly to my gmail account i did a quick google search and discovered scores of people who have had kevin martin attack them as well over relatively minor service issues i have also found numerous claims of forgeries being sold through piece of the past so i dont know what im going to do now im going to have to go through all the pieces i purchased from them and have them authenticated its such a sad thing that this man ruined a good client business relationship over a few dollars but consumers deserve to be treated better than this i rarely write negative reviews but i once again say beware these people are dishonest rude and will leave you in a state of utter shock at the way you were treated|0
best ice cream in the city pricier than chain ice cream places but the price is relative to the quality of the ingredients that eds uses such as am arena fabric wild cherries the only downside to eds is the constant lineups that extend out the door but since their service is fast this is really just a testament to how good their ice cream is and not an indicator of a efficiently run shop|1
got the alignment and a rotation of tires done actually the rotation had to be rescheduled because the wheel locks werent in the car but the management was very accommodating giving me the possibility to bring the car back to get it done in a different day staff was friendly and the service was done quickly price was fair and cheaper than what was asked at the car dealer previously i got a set of 4 run flat tires for a different car and the price was also good|1

this place has the absolute worst customer service that ive experienced in my life i lost my health card about a week ago and this was the last place i had it i went there the next day and they took down my contact information and said they would give me a call the next day i never received a call i decided to give them a call and it went through to customer service the woman was very rude when i said hello i told her my situation and asked whom i should call and she responded with a sigh and a hang on a second she put me on hold for about two minutes and didnt even take my name i dont even think she checked because it was way too short of a time to look when she came back said i theres nothing here i said oh okay quite shocked at her tone then she said yeah i bye and hung up on me i just got off the phone around ten minutes ago ive worked in customer service before so believe me when i say this woman should not be working in customer service she was very rude and condescending all that i wanted was the number for whom i should call and she should have connected me to the proper department so much for customer service i wish zero stars was an option cause this place would surely get one|0

my husband toddler and i attended a photo shoot at storia a few months back and had a wonderful experience with our photographers christine and jessica we were later brought back in to review our photos which like the other reviewer indicated was very touching at that time we placed our order and looked forward to our photographs becoming art we specified that we wanted to see a proof before the order was completed when our order was due to be picked up and after i contacted them three times without reaching anybody we were informed that they had lost our order and requested that we submit a copy of the invoice so that they could process it no explanations were offered just an apology weeks later we were told that our order was ready to be picked up i contacted storia and advised them that as per our order we had requested that proofs be sent proofs were sent via email all in all they looked amazing except for one photo which was overly photoshopped and had an artificial look to it when i commented on this i was told it was likely my screen of course no offer to have it corrected as they had already gone through with the order overall the quality of the photography is excellent the sales pitch is aggressive and we ended up spending a huge amount of money the ad of photos that you get if you spend more than 100000 is such poor quality you cant do anything with it i was disappointed with the over air brushing that was done on one photo but the rest turned out very very well in hindsight i would not have made the same purchase however due to the high cost i would not go back to storia nor would i recommend them due to their business practices if a business is going to out out a customer like that for so many weeks through no fault of the customer an offer of compensation should be made there are many photography studios and we subsequently went with another one which treated us much better|0
visited the store purchased gifts and was sold products that they just added to my bill when attempting to return they advised only a 14 day policy unacceptable i advise everyone to avoid this location as they will not honor or provide any real resolution for product sold therefore you will need to file a dispute with your credit card company|0

you know ive been to a whole slew of waffle houses but this one is special to me the ones here always take good care of me here food is made well and quickly on every visit since may of 2017 ive visited this location about 10 times and theyve never failed to please i go more for the experience than the food and thats weird to say considering its just waffle house i will say they keep the temperature pretty comfortable compared to other we which like to run the ac and it be 20 below zero outside they do like to keep it pretty clean which is always a plus for me the bathroom was nice and clean my waitress kept checking on me and kept my drink refilled she was working by herself too so thats definitely worth merit here alone i really go out of my way to come to this waffle house because i know beyond a shadow of a doubt that ill receive great food fast along with quality customer service check them out if you havent been to this location its on my top list|1

i have been using ges for years and have nothing but good things to say griffin is extremely organized professional and always ensures you get exactly what you want i have used his service for homecoming prom graduation and birthday parties theyve all turned out better than i couldve imagined the party bus he uses is very clean big and it seems to have better air conditioning than other party buses i have been on in az another major thing that made ges different than other companies was the safety i felt super safe using his company since he has highly qualified drivers and ensures that alcohol is not provided to minors if you happen to purchase a package that includes alcohol if your e looking to hire someone for any type of event he is your guy i cant wait to use ges again for all my future events|1
i signed on with crappy agency 3 years ago and have applied for at least 100 jobs and not once did i ever get a call it became such a pathetic joke that i would apply for anything and everything and still would not get a call i gave it 1 star because i have no choice but to give something to write a review there should be negative ratings for this dump of an agency and then i would rate them a 5 stay away they are a waste of time wait they dont even give you any time garbage|0
i became a patient of do jeffs a couple of years ago while searching for treatment to help with injuries from a car accident i tried chiropractic care as a last resort because i had a horrible chiropractic experience in the past but do jeff single handedly changed my opinions on chiropractors and the benefits of chiropractic care do jeff takes his time with his patients and he really listens to help determine what your e needs are from adjustments to trigger points to advice on stretching diet and exercise do jeff takes a comprehensive approach to help deal with injuries and chronic pain as i mentioned i had a really bad experience with a different chiropractor that left me terrified of having my neck cracked i explained this fear to do jeff and he walked me through every step of the neck manipulation his professionalism and calm demeanor helped set me at ease to have my neck and upper spine adjusted and now i cant believe i was ever able to function without it speaking of comfort do jeffs office has a great spa like feel which helps you relax during the adjustments although i still feel the effects of my accident do jeff has helped lessen my pain and stiffness and taught me ways to increase the strength and flexibility of my neck and shoulders going to do jeff has been a real game changer for me and im forever grateful for his help if anyone in the pittsburgh area is looking for an exceptional chiropractor i would highly suggest giving do jeff a try you wont be disappointed|1

worst costumer service ever i went there to correct my hair colour which i didnt like it after a trial at home i bought a deal from group on for cut colour and style for a good price and i phoned them before i purchase it to make sure and i explained my hair i situation but when i went there they told me that the deal is only for short hair so i need to pay way more to colour my hair since i could not cancel the purchase we made a deal with the manager of the store she told me colour correction plus high lights will cost me around 190 and cutting and styling is included i agreed and a week after i went there they coloured my hair but nothing exactly have changed still same colour that i wanted to change and they did not give me the deal when i asked about highlights manager was like thats not included in your price you have to come 3 more times and each time 90 she denied the verbal agreement and i wasted all that money without any change in my hair what a crook she was|0
why in the world is a 0 star rating not possible ill start this review off by saying that im not new to looking for rental properties on the afternoon of april the with i was firmly introduced to the absolute worst customer service experience ive ever received from an apartment complex while looking for a respectful apartment for my girlfriend and myself i noticed this company off apartments com and zil low i had read the warnings from prior tenants and unfortunately chose to ignore them my girlfriend and myself entered the front office where we stood for approximately two minutes before being rudely greeted by an unknown redhead associate of the apartment complex with the ignorant statement of so i have no models to show you we have one rental and its going for xbox amount at no point in time was i asked of what i was looking for nor was i offered to be given any further information about the apartment complex or the process to further finding a possible home in this clearly poorly run waste of a time if your e currently looking for an apartment i strongly advise you to heed the warning that i chose to ignore and look elsewhere if you already live here i feel incredibly sorry that youve been duped avoid this place at all costs|0
no stars for this establishment i was in the store for over 50 minutes steve the owner kept taking care of other customers while i patiently waited he kept having side conversations while he kept putting off finishing my order i finally said to please stop all the conversation so i can get my order completed he said i was welcome to take my box back after a few minutes i decided to leave best decision ever he quoted me 323oo for mailing my package with insurance the next day i drove to the ups customer care center in tempe yes a far drive but well worth the service and for the same packing shipping and insurance cost me 17800 i will not recommend post net to the grayhawk community he was going to send my box fed ex ground i called fed ex they only insure artwork up to 1000 i wasnt going to have the proper coverage after all the time spent in the store not impressed|0
ive been going to see karla since she was still in maricon whats that like six or seven years now and i have honestly never been to another stylist well ok twice but i learned my lesson i am not your average salon goer i see karla may be once a year if were lucky although there was one point where it was nearly 3 years between salon appointments and yet despite not being the most repetitive customer karla remembers everything ive been doing to my hair everything ive been doing in my life and everything ive ever told her about me her service is personalized down to a i every time i call her up its like no time has passed between our last appointment she always takes my hairs needs into account letting me know styling tips and tricks for my wildly curly hair and doing services she knows will last the 52 weeks until i see her again even if she double books clients which shes done only once with me she makes sure to make the switching work between clients and keeps us both involved in the conversation she is never rude or forgetful and always has a smile on her face and a story to tell|1
wouldnt entertain doing what i asked only wanted to do my repair exactly according to the estimate i have no idea if they do good or timely work i guess they didnt want to send a car out with less than recommended work i can get any body shop to take my insurance companys money so ill go somewhere else again next time|0

very good food i really liked the parmesan crusted bread they used on my sandwich i could just eat that on its own my hubby had a burger and said it was good as well they hand make the chips they were tasty and crunchy i had some apple pie which was full of cinnamon the bottom crust was a little less cooked than i prefer but definitely still edible they have an elvis sandwich on the menu fried with peanut butter banana honey and you can add bacon i need to try this next time for sure|1

awful limo service our 24 pass hummer was un vaccuum ed for my bridal party the driver introduced himself to me and the first thing he told me the groom was that tip was included but if i liked his service i could tip more very classy not the driver was very anxious and bossy he tried bossing around my camera guy and got in the way of our photography shoot which was unnecessary and annoying to say the least driver was giving bad information to bridal party about the guest shuttle service which was none of his business and added stress to my day driver told the bride that we couldnt go to a photo location because we didnt have time even though we did and arrives to hall 40 mins before our limo time was up driver made wrong turn right before reception hall and his only job at that point was getting from point a to point i something you could train a chimpanzee to do driver got us to hall at 620pm and we had paid for limo until 7 he asked me if i liked his service as i exited the black hummer i said yes and walked away there was no way i was adding to his tip driver left half hour before our paid time was up office people are rude on the phone i would avoid this company at all cost they just dont get it|0

this is the worst shawarma place ever ive been today afternoon to bring lunch for my family and the person who took the order was rude and doesnt have any customer service experience ive requested not to put rice or fries on the meal as im on diet and he responded with rudeness what do want i stated that only salad with shawarma will be good when he filled the plate with the meal he took some of the shawarma back again and i said why you did that but he did not replied also the shawarma was not fresh and it seems to be leftover from yesterday not recommended at all there is another shawarma restaurant just 100 i to the south i heard it is much much better avoid buying from this restaurant this is the first and hopefully the last time for me|0

being a broke college student i decided to give them a shot since i was overdue for a cut and short on cash the ladies here were all very nice and sincere when talking to them they werent overly talkative though overall the haircut was good nothing special but more thorough than most great clips cuts ive gotten and at 11 its 34 cheaper too kim the lady who cut my hair was also partially asian like myself and was able to appreciate what my somewhat ethnic hair needs on the way out they gave me a 3 off coupon and with my financial situation not soon changing i will definitely be back for my 8 cut|1
we are big manera fans and we go there often the last few times service has fallen off tonight when we went they left items out of the order and the food was cold we tried calling 4 times over a 30 minute period but nobody answers their phones we the wasted 15 more minutes waiting for corporate to answer the last time we tried calling and nobody answered so we gave up|0

sudden shade was amazing he was personable and very easy to work with he did a great job and was such a pleasure to have in my home i would definitely recommend him|1
best chinese food ever my family and i love this place we might even call this our home away from home haha my boyfriend and i first discovered this quaint little restaurant a year and a half ago and we have been coming back ever since sometimes 2 or 3 times a month the parking is adequate the food is amazing and the staff goes above and beyond to make you feel welcome i absolutely love the moo goo gai pan and egg drop soup my boyfriend cant get enough of the kung pow cabbage my children ages 3 5 6 always eat the sweet and sour chicken and they actually like the egg rolls which is a huge win the prices are almost unbelievable for the amount of food you get the portions are huge you will always have leftovers also they have the most genuinely friendly staff who are willing to make any accomodations to please you everything about this place is perfect what i like most is that i can always count on having a pleasant time filled with great food and service when i eat here there are some restaurants i enjoy eating at but i never know what kind of service im going to get or how well my food will be prepared because the staff is always different the grand dragon has consistently provided the best service to my family and i for over a year and i would recommend them to anyone|1
at first glance the clinic is run down and not modern at all from the exam rooms to the washroom and to the waiting area everything seems rustic and worn down there is plenty of seating room but definitely not enough seats for the amount of people waiting i have been to many walk in clinics in my lifetime as finding a family doctor in the he ga that is what i am looking for is pretty much close to impossible waiting at walk ins is pretty much inevitable but this experience was just horrendous as i checked in as a new walk in patient there were four front desk personnel all chatting and ignored my presence when she finally took time away from her personal chit chat i was not greeted with a smile or any friendly gesture at all they were quite impatient and rude after sitting for an hour and a half and seeing patients come and go i was becoming slightly agitated as to why there were people who came way after me and was seen before me so i approached the front desk and inquired how many more clients ahead of me she glanced at her chart i stole a glance too and she said that i was next but wait that was not true because when i looked at the chart there were names below me and before me that had already been checked off and seen which means that they missed my name and failed to call me note i did not leave the clinic once during the waiting period so i did not miss my name it was just terrible that the staff did not apologize at all on the other hand the female doctor i had seen and read reviews before going to this unprofessional clinic was amazing she made my visit worthwhile i have been looking to find a female doctor who was as friendly thorough and compassionate as her do trina lie unfortunately she only works mondays thursdays and does not accept patients otherwise i would have loved to take her as my family doctor i cant comment on the other doctors but for those looking to find a very good female practitioner i would recommend do trina lie if you can put up with the office and their staff that is overall i would never come here unless i had issues that i only feel comfortable expressing in front of a female doctor because the staff were just extremely unprofessional and the wait times are excruciatingly long and they had just opened when i got there too i will be back in the future and will make an update if anything changes|0
really fun for kids 7 who know how to ride a bike a bit pricey but if you spend the whole day there i guess its worth it we spent 5 hours there today next time we will bring snacks so the kids can refuel|1

dont take your dog here unless he is a saint we took our mo old lab puppy here a handful of times and every time we had them dangling the threat of kicking him out if he didnt straighten up we take our dog to the dog park regularly and he doesnt act the way they portrayed him to act every time at pick up i believe the owners and staff are a bit hypersensitive to what i consider to be standard dog behavior when they are at play i want to drop my dog off for the day and not have to worry about him until i pick him up which simply didnt happen here|0
this has to be the most disgusting food i have ever ordered in my entire life i was drinking last night and needed to stuff my face before going to bed even being drunk i was unable to eat the garbage it is hands down the worst cheeseburger and poutine i have ever had in my life i feel so ashamed and upset that i actually spent 25 for these two things thinking of what i could have eaten elsewhere the burger which i had to remove from the bun and just eat it was full of coleslaw that soaked the bun im actually impressed with myself that i even ate the burger without the bun which isnt real meat it was a mushy wet mess the poutine was extremely large and covered in a garbage cheese and horrible gravy it was dry old not fresh in anyway aside from about 5 bites it went to the garbage even drunk this food was intolerable and unacceptable worst food ever im assuming the only reason this place is in business is because of drunk people like me who fall upon it because nothing else is open i assure you that if you order from here you will highly regret it even worse not only do you have to tip the driver they charge a delivery fee lol shameful|0
note if i could rate this place with zero stars that would be the rating this is a late review for our ride we took in the middle of february 2012 but better late than never so here it goes my husband and i bought the 2 hour group on special hoping for a great ride they took us for a ride alright first of all we called way in advance to make reservations for our horseback ride we were given a specific time to meet at their so called ranch and was even cautioned to be there at least 15 minutes prior to our scheduled ride time so as instructed we showed up 15 minutes early for our ride only to find a desolate looking property with a picnic table and porta potty in the middle of nowhere with no staff to be found the hubby and i were initially confused and thought we might be in the wrong place as we did not see anything that resembled a ranch or a place that even had horses so i called the number that they was provided to me at the time i made the reservations and was told that we were in the right area and to just wait and that someone will be there shortly 12 past our reserved time a rude young lady shows up and tells us to fill out our forms and to pay the mandatory gratuity of 2000 each now i am all for tipping someone when it is deserved but the last time i checked a gratuity is something whether it be monetary or of other means was a voluntary thing if it was a required fee then they should just include this gratuity in the actually fees instead of forcing people to tip a certain amount or to even have to give a tip at all where is the incentive of providing good service if you know you will have a guaranteed tip yah there is none so after all of that stuff was taken care of now we had to wait another 12 hour before we got mounted on our horses we sat on our horses for another good 30 minutes or so before embarking on our ride so for a ride that was supposed to start at 1430 ended up starting at 1630 and ending at around 1800 and yes if you do the math you will realize that the so called 2 hour ride was actually only 1 and 12 hours because they claimed that the horses were getting restless and could not take anymore and that the sun was going down so we should just head back in miho if you paid for 2 hours worth of services i would think that you should get what you paid for the horses were fine and whos fault was it anyways that the sun was going down theirs the staff took too long to start the ride and in turn we as customers got cheated out on the ride itself was quite pathetic it took place on asphalt paved roads that went to through a residential area it there was no scenery as they lead you to believe there is via their website and the staff did not assist with taking pictures of you on their horses with your own personal camera because they wanted you to buy their 1 and only picture that they take of you prior to starting your ride the horses were a mixed bag of well mannered and spunky i would not recommend this ride for anyone especially a beginner who has never rode on a horse before i am an experienced horse rider so fortunately i am able to control and handle a horse who on occasion felt like galloping trotting this would have been very scary for someones first horse ride the entire ride was a sham and really the only thing that made this ride exciting and enjoyable was the fact that my horse was a little spunky and decided to speed up a bit but as i had said earlier if you were not experienced at horse back riding then this by all means would not have been a fun thing at all and you i probably never want to ride a horse again out of fear the staff was quite inattentive to the riders as there was a elderly male on our tour that was suffering with severe back and leg pain they allowed him to ride with a cast on his leg it was quite evident that he was suffering because he was moaning and groaning in pain loudly and basically hanging half way off of his horse trying to find a comfortable position i hope this review will serve as a warning to all to not book any horseback riding tours with this company there are a few other horseback riding tours in the red rock area that provide an awesome time with lovely scenery and then some you really do get what you pay for so if something is a little to cheap to believe it is save your money and pay for a legit tour it will definitely be worth the extra few bucks never again total rip off and waste of time|0
you gotta love the easy way this place works you get exactly what you want because you put the bowl together mix up the right combination of sauces and you get a great tasting plate of food the customer service was great too im glad they opened up another location a little closer to where i live now if we could only get one up in the no part of the valley we would be great|1
this was my wifes favourite restaurant when she was younger but she had not been in years it was not as she remembered service was disinterested at best and our steak supposed to be medium rare was over cooked on the outside and raw in the middle we would have sent it back but we were with some older folks most of the clientele was older perhaps remembering better days at oscars|0
all walmart i go into are garbage when you call to ask about a product no one knows anything there prices are more than daves super market plus when you have a credit card with them they spend it along with you i dont believe they hire professionals cause they cant afford them im through with them and be sure to tell everyone i know they are better off at dollar general andi than there sad sad place of business|0

i saw the bad reviews but still purchased our tour based speaking with the woman via phone and finding out that they are affiliated grey lines pink jeep tours etc it was a dream come true as we embarked on a 5 hours drive to the south rim of famous grand canyon it had been an experience where words will fall miserably short to express the real scenario and my feelings so is my endeavour to capture the beauty through my smart phone lol it was something which can only be experienced through all your senses but seldom can be expressed through any medium of expression our bus driver and guide manuel was the fittest person for the job and made our experience even better with his continuous commentary about the place its history geography geology and many other things manuel could cater to all age groups and personalities he helped all of us in enjoying the place fully he is very flexible as well as well planned in his job in fact he made us enjoy the 5 hour drive from las vagus to the canyon and back too by constantly telling us about the surrounding geography and evolution of the place in fact this was the most memorable part of my trip to las vegas which saying a lot because i did a lot we also had a small tour to hoover damm which was breath taking as well he let us take some breathtaking pictures and even went out of his way to take to an overlook point right outside of the hoover damm location which was much appreciated this company also offers what they promise neat clean coach bus grey line decent sized group fabulous guide and a voucher at a food stop for lunch i fully recommend them for the canyon tour my experience was flawless and perfect and everyone on the bus was pleased with his tour the bus has 2 outlets so you can charge your phone and also had a bathroom in the back for everyones conv in ence|1
est time here and the owner gave me attitude he was actually pretty funny about it like a shop in philly or new york came here on thursday around 230 and dropped off three pair of designer jeans to get shortened not kidding they were ready by 5 am the same day highly recommended professional services on my jeans they look great will come here again very reasonable prices|1

i hired a personal trainer and paid 1500 and got 3 months free well when i finished with my trainer i continued and then while working out in august i pulled my sciatica nerve and had to discontinue my monthly dues so i noticed today on my credit card account they have been charging my credit card 2999 per month for the past 9 months i called the headquarters of abc fitness who charges my card and they said i had to call the anytime fitness myself and get seem bur ced but they would halt the monthly draw on my credit card so i called the local anytime fitness in gilbert and left a message so a manager patricia returned my call and was very rude and refused to issue a credit to my card i asked her to have the owner call me but she said he would not want to be bothered so be advised there are other anytime fitness gyms dont go to this one very dissatisfied with the management so now i have to spend time and take them to small claims court all for 26991|0
not worth it ive been to other la nic as and the service was excellent i waited over an hour after sitting down to get my food would not come back server only checked on te table for drinks and to bring the food|0
i filed for bankruptcy with james gentile this is the only time i have ever filed so instead of getting a paralegal to file my paperwork i paid an outrageous amount of money to make sure everything was done properly explained to me thoroughly and there to represent me in court well regrettably i signed a contract with james gentile to do the exact same thing a paralegal would have done the only difference was he was there in court but answered may be 2 questions while at the trustee meeting james gentile and his office staff are completely unorganized rude un accommodating and inefficient they act as if your e a burden and as if your e not the one paying them 2000 to stay on top of their stuff they asked me for paperwork multiple times that i had already turned in they kept for getting my situation and so they would call me to turn in things that i wasnt even required to jim obviously wouldnt look at any of my paperwork before i would get a rude phone call from them saying they need something immediately they didnt go over my list of accounts with me before they sent the paperwork in so i had to do an addendum to add 2 accounts they said i should have looked through the accounts like this is something i should have known to do when they pulled me into their office and rushed me to sign the papers to file that had the accounts on them they pulled everything from my credit so being that this is the only time i have filed i figured that would have included everything but it didnt totally not even worth 200 that it would have cost for a paralegal because i ended up needing to double and triple check everything on my end and to still be receiving calls from his rude office staff stating that they need things they already got and i have already been discharged i just got home with my newborn and this is the first phone call i get totally ruined my mood do not go to these people they are crooks i can not wait until i am done paying them for nothing and they are put in the past|0
spicy chinese cooked by chinese we ate in service was fast and courteous the dress was informal and the restaurant interior quaint just a place to sit and eat as soon as we sat down our waiter brought us a carafe of tea the waiter brought plates with chopsticks we had to ask for forks so we knew that we were the exception a good thing i ordered the szechuan fried rice extra spicy my wife and daughter ordered the regular szechuan fried rice we found the fried rice spicy we ordered pigs feet sweet and sour chicken and popcorn chicken the food was delicious the highest praise that i can ever give an establishment is by answering the question would i go back yes we would go back|1
food is good but the last time i was in the woman taking the orders had a lot of attitude even when we walked in after awkwardly ordering from her and receiving our food i was a bit annoyed from how loud she was playing her movie on the to but no biggie next i split the mediocre hot sauce on the table thing and asked for for napkins for the three of us she only gave me one napkin and when i told her theres 3 of us and we spilt sauce she only gave me 3 more i dont know if they where having a napkin shortage or something but i just wanted to clean the mess we made so after trying our best and getting like 80 of the sauce in our boxes to throw out says are you guys seriously going to leave that there in a very rude tone 1 its your job to clean up and 2 i asked you twice for more napkins so what i told her next was not the nicest of words but she definitely deserved it because of the horrible service and disgusting attitude she was giving to paying customers i hope you are reading this woman who served me because i take great satisfaction in knowing most likely you or that cook cleaned up that mess would of been 15 but the chicken is alright|0
my mainstay for dim sum in calgary im practically here on a weekly basis in fact im here so often that the service is somewhat approaching friendly and i think i even saw a smile once otherwise unheard of in a chinese restaurant i really like happy hill for a couple of reasons its a bit separated from the crazy drivers and parking hassles in the epicentre of chinatown its a smaller restaurant which translates into shorter waits and fewer screaming babies the dim sum is steamed after you order it with the order list printed in both english and chinese the dim sum has always been excellent with one caveat although this is one of the few restaurants ive found in calgary that serves xiao long bao shanghai soup dumplings dont get too excited because the wrapper is too thick and too often the soup has already leaked out by the time it reaches your table the restaurant certainly doesnt lose points for trying though i guess i need to find an excuse to get back to shanghai or at least to ding tai fung outside toronto they also do hot pot here but i haven i had it for quite a number of years i always end up here for dim sum instead 20 for two people with leftovers|1
i have been a regular customer for about a year or so now and these guys are true barbers from the old country europe they learned the craft the old way through the guild system in italy not through cosmetology at a local community college these guys running through the family craft as it seems have always done a great job and especially with shaving my face they are more than barbers they are artists they also shave the old way with a straight razor and it is perfect when done i have the face like a baby when they are done with me i always chose them for simple cuts and great shaves the way barbers were always supposed to be for men but i recently came in for a short haircut and shave and i noticed that they had a new guy with a russian last name renting a space in their shop the economy is real bad now so many businesses like barber shops have to do such things for extra income he wasnt the nicest guy and he did a decent job on my short clean up of my hair i then asked for a shave and i noticed that he did not finish the job as well as the other older gentlemen there i still had a little stubble around my face he then offered a facial after the shave i decided to do it since i never had such things done to me ever before man it took a long time for everything to be done and the price was quite steep too 70 all together a five minute hair clean up a shave with a little stubble around my nose and lower lip and then the facial man i had to pay up when i gave him a 7 tip he gave me a funny look he said thanks and goodbye but i felt like he just wanted to increase his pay for that day and make as much money as possible and then i heard one of the old regular barbers at roma say well you earned your rent oh well i guess that i will have to find another barber in town|0

unbelievable i just called to speak to a rep to may be get an estimate of services and front desk rep by the name of mackenzie said she would have someone return my call ok fine but then she started asking detailed questions not about the appliance about me i wasnt ready to answer i wasnt even sure they could help me may be im just more private but why do you need my last name and exact address to know if you can help me i offered cross streets for relevancy but she didnt want them seemed like when i asked when i could expect a callback she said she could answer that but would not that down i asked will i be called today she couldnt answer that either i guess ill keep looking|0
i wish i could give this 0 stars i had every detail for what i wanted in my trip the location hotel month price etc and all i requested was she look into which dates in that month are cheapest she told me she did not have the time to waste on checking that sort of information and if i wanted to do all of the work she would then book for me isnt that their job to do the work went to another travel agent the same day and had an amazing experience what a joke|0

condensed for yelp hot restaurant seems the restaurant opened without testing the air conditioning and we the customers paid the price further the restaurant was filled with smoke likely due to a combination of an insufficient exhaust over their authentic charcoal grill and the lack of air conditioning by the end of the meal we were all eager to leave as we had begun to cough and my eyes had been tearing since our arrival restaurant is well laid out with unprocessed wood paneling adorning the walls and comfortable booths that offer adequate privacy cloth napkins but the tables were covered in butchers paper rather than cloth odd mix between classy and casual and we werent sure what look the restaurant was going for charcoal grill is great but seeing the chef with no hair protection hat or otherwise sweating over it made me question what was going on in the areas i could not see of the kitchen we were offered sparkling or plain water as well as a basket of bread in another odd turn the bread presented was bakery bought rye bread which was grilled with olive oil sesame seeds and za at ar which while tasty seemed very amateurish as opposed to the fresh rolls may be with sesame seeds and za at ar which i would normally expect at a high end restaurant between the 4 of us we shared a total of four entrees appetizers in us starting with a delicious hummus topped with sauteed mushrooms 10 next was the spicy hungarian sausage with peppers caramelized onions black olives and tomato sauce 18 sausages had a good spice to them without being too hot and the vegetables mixed well together but the black olives actually kalamata completely overpowered the sausage and could have in fact been a dish all their own this was a good thing because we found that after 6 fork ful i we had plenty of peppers caramelized onions and black olives but no sausage which was disappointing for a dish where the highlight should have been the sausage next to be tried was the duck carpaccio served with salad 16 while we had envisioned a salad complimenting the duck what were received were as one of my companions put it six fingernail sized pieces of duck which were 50 fat served over a garden salad with a vinaigrette i made the mistake of trying the duck with the salad and found the flavor of the duck completely overpowered by the vinaigrette the only redeeming aspect about this dish was that we had ordered 2 servings otherwise there would not have been enough duck for us each to taste lastly came the real star of the entrees which was the beef tartar served with french fried matchsticks 18 all of us agreed the tartar was excellent with a great mix of green onion fresh beef and very light seasoning sure to agree with anyones palette while i would generally tell those with less adventurous palates to avoid any sort of raw beef dish this one had a solid consistency which was not unlike tuna tartar and in a good way the fine cut of the meat really allowed the flavours to meld and the dish melt in your mouth i would have liked the tartar to be served with toast points or the like but was still quite happy to eat it straight from my fork the only addition i would make to the tartar would be some citrus to really brighten up the flavours and make them pop for our mains two of us shared the grilled beef ba vetted 28 and grilled rack of lamb with wild mushrooms 55 both prepared to the chefs recommendations of medium rare and medium respectively the grilled ba vetted was very good and had an excellent texture if not simple being seasoned with only salt though personally i would have preferred more to be done with the lamb it was well prepared and served as whole rack with 3 generous ribs both juicy and tender the lamb had the perfect texture even while being rare in the middle and was one of few things we ordered which had a good value in terms of side dishes together we sampled all 3 on offer which were rice french fries and vegetables while the vegetables were unremarkable they were simply grilled the french fries were soggy and oily while the rice was prepared mexican style and was reminiscent of a box of near east rice one would buy when needing a side dish in a hurry one companions had salmon tartar 15 and the other an 18 oz rib steak 34 salmon tartar was termed as tastes fishy and not fresh while the steak was prepared to the specified medium but was seasoned with pepper only and had no flavour otherwise wheres the salt not bad but steak was of equal or lesser quality than that available at the supermarket butcher and far more expensive meal had good parts and bad difficult to evaluate because of the smoke waitress needed to learn the menu but they had a decent looking fish selection for such a pricy place they should have given something free to compensate for the heat menu needs some retooling but they do have potential|0

i have never written a negative review for a business but this i felt was necessary i had gotten my hair relaxed a couple times by the owner of hot locks and it turned out well the last time i had my hair relaxed i felt something was not right my scalp felt tight and hair super flat after a day i realized my roots were at a 90 degree angle and that she had given me permanent hair bends i had a trip to europe for a month and when i got back went immediately to the salon the owner took no blame and even told me it was probably due to the water in europe after doing my own research i knew it was because she applied the chemical at the root and not an inch away from the scalp so now a few months later my roots have grown out two inches and are breaking off at the end causing thinning and coarse looking hair my hair will be ruined for the next two years until it grows out since there is no way to reverse this damage not only did the owner ruin my hair but she also took no blame nor did she give me my money back she gave me a free deep conditioner then convinced me to get a hair cut and buy 30 worth of hair products saying it would help tremendously i was desperate if you want quality hair care i suggest going elsewhere|0

well i can not have two such amazing experiences and not post about this incredible hair salon my first experience was for myself after having an exceptionally difficult and stressful week i walked into mane stream on suffering hoping that by some miracle on a saturday afternoon they would have time to give me a haircut and may be a highlight i was referred by a friend but had never been there they were completely booked up but when they saw the sad look on my face they were so generous and made time for me lori one of the owners was the stylist to do my hair i can not say enough fabulous things about her she was so kind and personable all of her coworkers rallied around her and showered me with compliments the entire time which honestly was quite wonderful after the week i had she was also extremely talented i left feeling as if i made a new friend and as if i was the most gorgeous creature on the planet i receive compliments everywhere i go and am thrilled with the cut highlights and little purple accents she threw in to the back to really pick up my look the second was this afternoon for my 10 year old daughter we were lucky enough to score dylan another supremely talented hair artist i call him that because he is so talented he truly is the michelangelo of hair my daughter has very sophisticated taste for her age and usually gets told the haircuts she chooses are too old for her age not from dylan he got excited about her ideas and created a truly beautiful haircut she was so thrilled with it that she asked very sincerely if she could hug him she is still bouncing from the special treatment and from what she calls her new super awesome ultra cool hairdo please if you love to look fabulous and love to be around wonderful fun people who will treat you right go immediately to mane stream on suffering a few shops down from tim horton youll want to thank me|1

what can i say i love love love taco i do prefer a good smokie but these tacos reminded me of my extended stay in mexico when i was hanging out with pedro and manuel in juarez what they showed me in 3 nights in room f322 and the local est ac in de polic a taught me what a taco should be like the meat filling was succulent and i was able to enjoy every bite truth be told i couldnt get enough in my mouth the toppings of sour cream and spicy salsa brings back naughty memories that are best kept secret but the salad oh the salad was to die for the fresh green lettuce a top of my taco had me wetting my mouth long before i started and if it wasnt for the do pepper i had i think i would have just died the tacos are wonderfully crafted by the finest filipino hands this side of mexico|1

i saw do bomb to set a fracture that occurred over a holiday weekend by the time i left the office i had been there almost 2 hours i sat in a little exam room for close to an hour while i listened to the doctor get a find my i phone tutorial on the other side of the door im not even joking they did this for almost an hour while they tried to find the doctors phone which they could see from the program was clearly in the building thus it wasnt an emergency when he finally did breeze in he offered no apology and barely offered a greeting he looked at my xray said my hand is broken said to cast it and turned to walk out he didnt explain anything to me did not ask me if i had any questions didnt tell me what to expect i stopped him to ask questions and he was condescending and impatient then he shifted me off to the cast room where i waited again for someone to come she finally did hurriedly wrapped my arm ive never had a cast before but i think the job she did was mediocre given how much fiberglass is touching my bare skin and sent me on my way i chose do bomb because of his top doc rating im truly befuddled as to why that was awarded it certainly wasnt for patient care or respect|0

i am posting this yelp review as a courtesy warning to those looking for low gas prices i am a rideshare driver and always look for the lowest priced gas in my area i came across rhino mart on pyle and pollock which sells gas for 249 per gallon be advised you must pay cash to receive the lower priced gas also you must ask for a receipt as rhino mart employees will only print a receipt when asked anyway i was okay with paying cash and made rhino mart my usual morning stop before beginning my day on one occasion i was a bit low on cash and purchased only ten dollars worth of gas after pumping the gas i noticed that my gas gage only slightly moved things that make you go humm today i started out with 12 tank and again pumped only ten dollars worth of gas at rhino mart i then proceeded to my usual staging area at south point casino just a few blocks away i wasnt feeling very well so i complete only one ride before returning home heres the route i took i picked up my passenger near silverado ranch bled and las vegas bled just one block from south point my passengers destination was the fashion show mall on las vegas bled after dropping off my passenger i drove directly home near silverado ranch bled and serene when i glanced at my gas gage i was taken a back to see that my gage needle returned to 12 tank according to my tripadvisor app the entire route took approximate 14 minutes and consisted of only 8 miles this is easily verifiable via mapquest for those looking for verification that being said something is terribly wrong at rhino mart is it possible that i did not receive my full ten dollars worth of gas lol again things that make you go humm im sure its no surprize to yelp readers that rhino mart has lost me as a steady and once daily customer on the upside lefty pizza is located right next to rhino mart great pizza|0
this place is wonderful pretty and cute the staff here is also friendly and helpful ive had a few brazilians done here and have been very happy i wouldnt think twice to come here again as i always do its fairly expensive but good service for what you pay for i didnt give it five stars because they ask that you take your shoes off at the entrance which is a very small corner with just shoes just scattered everywhere kind of annoying stepping in a puddle of melted snow in the winter and ending up with wet socks|1
i have dealt with them on 3 occasions was told that i was needed immediately not once has the job actually gone through nor do they ever send any paperwork they are horrible at communicating they definitely need better organized head hunters if you are desperate give them a shot otherwise hold out for a better company|0
best corned beef in cleveland forget what you have heard about sly mans or any other place this is the gem that no one really knows about the place has horrible atmosphere but that is not what you should be there for|1
i eat here at least 2 times a week because they have the best chicken ho fun noodles i have ever had from anywhere its like the ultimate comfort food to me the sauce they use perfectly coats the noodles and its not the gravy type of sauce some places use i also really love the spring rolls even though they are pretty simple they advertise them as shrimp spring rolls but each one has only one very small shrimp inside which i normally pick out because i dont care for shrimp in my spring rolls the hot and sour soup is good and has a nice kick to it the miso soup was very salty tasting to me so i dont order that anymore even though the tofu chunks were nice and large the prices here are fabulous and the owners are very nice they know me when i come in and always make my food consistently delicious|1
i have to say their biq chicken pizza is better than what you can get at other pizza place my family loved it it was the only comfort food we thought of trying on new years 2014 eve and it didnt disappoint this review is coming from a person who hasnt had a slice of pizza for almost three years i dont really like pizza but this one is good happy new year|1
i ordered a birthday cake from this bakery thinking that it would be really good since one of my relatives constantly gets their birthday cakes from this establishments upon digging into the cake i found a piece of an eggshell inside their green tea mousse cake help at least i know they use brown eggs as well when i went to pick the cake up i noticed a rather foul and dank smell to this place i decided to give this place a second chance and when i picked up my order i noticed the foul and dank smell again but this time it was so strong my nose could not bear it for another second and i was holding my breath in for as long as i could until i could reach the door i am now avoiding this place like the plague and trying cakes from other bakeries from now on|0
waste of time they couldnt verify a bank of america check i needed to cash dont worry theyll waste your time and make you fill out all the paper work first though|0
i will never shop at this store again they had a large piece of pottery on a shelf with two small pieces and a painted wooden plate behind leaning against the back of the cabinet i had removed the large pot to see the price on the bottom and was returning it to the shelf when the painted wooden plate slid and ejected one of the smaller pots on the floor the pot that i was replacing never touched the wooden plate it was the sliding and subsequent vibration that caused the wooden plate which was in a precarious stance to slip of course the clerk insisted we pay for the broken small pot which i agreed to even thou i was not wholly at fault for the accident this is the grievance the large pottery pot was 24 as marked and the small pottery pot which had no price marked on it was assigned a price of 11 by the clerk the clerk decided to take advantage of the situation and flagrantly over charge us for the small pot this is opportunistic and in my opinion lacking in character i will never shop at this store again and i encourage you to do the same see attached picture|0
the first thing that comes to mind is how incompetent their staff was today they argued about the 15 off add that was posted in better homes and gardens to which they finally understood one more thing we also had an additional 25 which we didnt discovered wasnt included after we got home their stock of to roni syrups was rediculous mostly sugar free which is horrible i wouldnt recomend this pe titular store as a choice|0
this is one of the worst taco bells in the valley and unfortunately its the closest one to my house anyway i dont get the urge to eat there all that often but when i do i dread going through the drive thru and interacting with the most incompetent worker who takes my order id say its 5050 and thats being kind if my order is correct i know that its bad management which has plagued this location for years do yourself a favor and go to the with and peril location youll be glad you did|0
this place is a hidden gem a legitimate quality massage no frills jasmine gave me my massage and it was amazing for the price is 100 worth it dont waste your time with those other places saying sehr its twenty bucks for a reason i practice a bit of martial arts and this massage was exactly what i needed|1
i love this day spa my first ever so i might be a newbie but it was worth the 150 tip that i splurge on my 90 min massage with lola the message felt like it would never end definitely the way to spoil pamper yourself and get away from reality i was there about two hours before my appointment and was greeted with friendly smiles and tour of the facility you can use the spa and steam room to relax and mentally prepare yourself before your massage the environment is calming and very clean the supply you with most toiletries shampoo conditioner hairspray lotion hair dryer curling iron etc im looking forward to come back for another or and hopefully enjoy the next one with my honey in a couples massage everyone deserves a little pampering once in a while|1
they never get the order right and then i have never got the large fries i order they always put smalls in the back and the wait for all this to happen is forever never again|0
i have only ever had bad experiences here some of the most disrespectful unprofessional employees ive ever seen had the worst most painful pedicure ive ever had today the woman who did my nails was not only rude she cut my ankle with the call us scraper cut an area around my cuticle rang me up at the end for double what i actually owed and stood over my shoulder as i entered in the tip amount very uncomfortable experience and i would not recommend this place at all|0
i have played silvering a few times now so i feel like i can give a review without using only one round as my measuring stick the course at silvering are decent nothing terrible but nothing special every time i have gone there though their course organization and tee time booking has been atrocious they have three nines with no starters and no one making sure that pace is kept the result of this is tee times seemingly booked 23 minutes apart sometimes and golfers starting on whatever nine that they feel like this causes major log jams on certain parts of the course while other parts are wide open for 5 holes at a time i gets really frustrating when your e trying to get a quick nine in after work and it takes 3 hours footnote they used to have gas units in all of their carts but they removed them all for some reason|0
what a disappointment ive been there a few times and i cant believe the customer service i thought i would try again thinking it would be different then i walked in i said hello and no one responded i asked them a question and the women responded in a horrible disrespectful tone i will never return i dont know how these people stay in business i wont recommend for anyone to shop there and being a personal shopper they lost me and all my clients shame|0
best fries ever good menu with a solid variety very good drink offerings it is a really well decorated and nice space great for brunch but always busy i like that the kitchen is open until late there are a few tis peppered around the upper bar area but not too distracting this sounds like a small detail but i think the place would look so much better if the servers wore uniforms or at least i shirts or something they are always in a random mash of button down shirts a couple people in a way too faded i shirt this isnt a super high end expensive place but the staff never looks very put together and for such a nice cozy decor they stick out like a sore thumb|1
terrible service and slow as a rock more than 20 mins for a coffee manager did not come out to help|0
the alterations she did on a bridesmaid dress and a mother of the grooms dress where just perfect turn around time was so quick will definitely use again i have recommended her to family and friends hope you all go to her|1
i recently visited this dental office for a basic dental cleaning it was my first time visit and will definitely be my last unfortunately i had the worst dental cleaning experience of my life first the dental hygienist named angela started spraying my teeth with water to start off the cleaning process completely fine right problem is she was so incompetent with the spray that the water sprayed all over my face hair and neck i let it go as they gave me an eye shield no big deal just a lot more water sprayed on me than usual i can handle that now i am no dental expert but if youve been visiting dental office yearly for cleansing you i know the general procedure they use this hook equipment to scrape over and in between teeth to help remove plaques and or stains all of my previous dental experiences have done this procedure identically going through each and every single tooth not at this site she used the hook to lightly tap on my teeth for the most part yes tap as if she was drawing little dots on and in between my tooth she didnt even scrape the ridges of my teeth barely did any cleaning for my premolar and molars which for me have always been cleaned in the past as these are often problem areas for me after what felt like an eternity of tapping my teeth gentle scraping not once did i manage to rinse out any sort of plaques further proofing that she was just half as sing her job if not less she polished my teeth after that was done she used the hooks again to tap at my teeth it was at this point i could no longer stand this garbage cleaning that i asked her if she was aware that she was barely doing any cleaning for my teeth with those hooks other than just tapping it on my teeth she started to get defensive and began to actually start using the hooks properly for my lower central incisors but then after that just started tapping again and again at my other teeth lastly she started flossing my teeth reminding me how to floss and at the same time not even properly flossing my teeth for the most part she just placed the floss string between my teeth and then just slide i the floss string right out without even pulling it out i mean what kind of dental hygienist are you if you cant even perform your most basic skills and use the tools correctly so there you have it my most memorable dental cleaning experience if any of you are looking for proper dental cleaning and considering this location id advise you to stay away unless you dont mind getting a half assed dental cleaning service|0

i contracted nadine to make a cake for my wedding last month it was a pretty simple wedding cake with not a lot of frills so this should have been easy for them despite our initial pleasant interaction with her the rest of the process was a bit of a nightmare dont be fooled by nadine i old lady charm she is shrewd and deceptive when it comes to making a buck we worked with over a dozen vendors for our wedding and nadine was the worst by far nearly all of the traits that we love in most of our vendors promptness fairness good personality punctuality well organized nadine lacked she was late for meetings failed to call back or follow up on important details and was unresponsive and disorganized when we had questions or concerns we set up an initial meeting with her partner jean who i would describe as flaky and abrasive her role was to understand what we wanted our cake to look like approve the design give us the cost information and book our date for the wedding though she managed to approve our cake design she apparently got the cost wrong to the tune of 200 despite me submitting a drawing explaining everything we wanted on the cake a week after our initial meeting it took 40 minutes to have her understand our simple minimalist cake design if youve dreamt up a design or had aspirations for more than the crusty old cakes that you see in nadine i display case turn around and walk out now better yet run nadine doesnt get it they are way out of touch with modern designs and to days brides concerns and vision dont expect nadine to email you or call for that matter expect her to lose paper work expect her to forget that you put down a down payment dont expect to pay with a credit card you will be lucky if she shows up to your final consultation meeting we chose nadine because we thought we could save a few hundred bucks on the cake we were wrong when it came down to it they ended up charging us more than we originally agreed to on our contract putting her pricing inline with many of the other more expensive bakeries nadine called me the day before my wedding to see if the flower and ribbon on the cake was to my i liking as if i had nothing better to do the day before my wedding the color of the rose was nothing like the color swatch i gave her and she said there was nothing she could do about it i told her this is why i had asked her to show me an example of the rose at our final meeting which she did not have and called me a liar saying she never agreed to do this on the day of the wedding the rose was more of a yellowish color than rose color as a i had requested and the ribbon was a much darker grey than i had asked for and to think i ended up paying more in the end for poor customer service added stress and a cake that didnt look like what i had requested what a disappointment i do not recommend anyone go to nadine i|0

five stars based on customer service alone last weekend i placed a carry out order for three separate orders of 24 wings i called hours in advance since i felt it was a good amount of food for a birthday party when i went to pickup my order they mistakenly only prepared 1 order of 24 wings i was disappointed but no big deal i still wanted the rest of my order they said it would take 15 minutes so i said id come back for the rest when i returned i reached for my wallet and the bartender waitress said its all comped it was our mistake so your e all set it was a classy way to handle a mistake and i really appreciated their response i dont live in the area but its a nice sports bar setup that also has a large outdoor patio oh and the wings were good too|1

all i can say is wow the food here is absolutely fantastic so flavorful my wife and i wanted to eat almost everything on the menu but finally had to decide on the scallops and the fish dish both were done to absolute perfection im usually a beef guy but we couldnt pass up these seafood selections i did see the cut of steaks at the next table over and i cant wait to go back and try the beef out looked spectacular the only thing that was a miss for us was it seemed a little short staffed for dinner and our server looked like he had a wide range of tables across the restaurant it took a little longer than expected to get our beverages hopefully well see that improved next time were in|1

i called west coast tattoo about a week prior to going to vegas and made an appointment with colin when i arrived i met with colin and showed him what i wanted done to an existing tattoo on my leg colin looked at it and explained what he was going to do in great detail and also offered some new ideas to add to it i immediately felt comfortable and he went to work when it was all said and done i was completely blown away by the work colin had done my tattoo far exceeded my expectations on how i thought it would turn out colin did a phenomenal job and we set up another session in august i totally recommend west coast tattoo to anyone looking for quality work and a friendly atmosphere|1
we were impressed with gary at the beginning but then had an issue in getting the information we wanted however gary and sam responded quickly and corrected it their pricing is less than the other quotes i received so we will most likely go with them i will update my review after they do the work|1
theyre always out of something never fails like another person says online ordering is a joke you order is never ready when you get there to pick it up hell half the time they havent even started on it yet id choose moes over this place|0
first off i came here three time in hopes of being good the the first two times me and my of went near closing so i understand the food is gonna be old and not fresh at all but i went today in hopes of okay its lunch time so i give it a shot so we go again and boy was i wrong it was gross the food was old it been sitting out for a while all the food we had was super salty and dry and on top of that it was 799 for the weekends that the same price as dinner and it the same food as it is everyday which i dont why it more on the weekends always all i have to say is the food is always gonna be old and dry and super salty and the service is bad as well|0
i come here at least once a week you cant really beat the price and the quality of service im always shocked at how quick my server is to pick up a piece of trash or refill our waters or how fast they run to our tables when we ask for additional sides my favorite appetizer is the gyoza i always ask for extra gyoza sauce because its the perfect blend of spices and so far no other sushi place can recreate the quality and taste such an amazing place highly recommended|1

do not use learned my lesson not a lot of info available about granite depot or cristian on the internet was professional when he gave me a quote and said he was licensed and insured he was never able to produce a certificate of insurance and there is no record of him being a licensed contractor said he was licensed under another company but couldnt confirm that either only investigated that after he wouldnt call text me back for weeks after he picked up the granite slab from the stone yard drove past his shop and saw that there was a piece missing from my 8x11 slab wouldnt return any of my polite texts phone messages after my ith attempt to find him at his shop and speaking with one of the workers there i got a call from the stone yard saying that he was dropping off my slab back at the original location without responding to any of my inquiries unsure if slab is usable for my purpose and manager at stone yard said the break looked like someone dropped it or hit it when transporting cristian finally texted me back after i called him out on returning a broken slab but no attempt from him to rectify that i will have to buy a new slab and identify a new fabricator after waiting 6 weeks for him to get to this point|0
i would give it zero stars if i could the only thing nice about this place is the actually visual appeal of the apartment itself which will not be enough once you make the mistake of signing a lease there is no security repairs take forever be theyre under staffed the leasing office worst in the city hard to get them to pick up a phone theyre poorly trained and rude they never get back to you and is information to seem like theyre helping you gates always broken amenities are a joke one side doesnt even have a gym yet i had the pleasure of hearing neighbors yelling and fighting every day every day police came out they still started right back up people out late at night all hours being loud safety is a constant concern worst mistake ever do not do what i did and fall for the prettiness of the apt you will hate every day here|0
nice people they just cant do nails my first experience here resulted in a very glob by looking gel manicure worst of all the lady went drill crazy and cut my skin on like 6 nails i tried to deal with it but after contemplating i returned the next day i asked for a polish change just to smooth the globs out and make the mani look more neat the end product was decent but i was shocked when the lady told me i had to pay 20 more for the color swap this was literally the next day like less than 24hrs later ive decided i spend wayyou too much to leave any nail salon feeling sub par about my nails needless to say i wont be returning|0
hadnt been here since i was under age and we used to pop by for a few drinks and karaoke a long long time ago now i feel as though ive been transported to gordon ram says kitchen nightmares i cant shake the english accent and the only thing keeping me laughing is the stories my son is telling us about his outdoor camp hes returned from we ordered as described on the menu 1 french fries 2 mozzarella sticks with marinara sauce 3 28 oven baked wings medium french fries arrived and they looked like shards of cardboard with some ugly and disgusting ly tasting garnish on them the heinz ketchup wasnt heinz at all but some topped up crap and the malt vinegar tasted like shit mozzarella sticks came all 5 of them for 1095 kids bit into them and said they had a strange taste i suggested they try the marinara even though it looked chunky my kids kept trying to dip them but the mozzarella sticks kept bouncing off the top i place my fork in only to find it was a small container of frozen salsa disgusting now the piece de la resistance wings they arrived big very big in fact however something looked wrong as a clear juice collected on the plate they had grill marks but noting to indicate medium wings at all my wife was the first to take a bite and the look on her face said it all i looked at my son and burst out laughing thinking about the terrible food he had while camping and this was suppose to be the good meal upon his return i ate one then another and fought to eat one last one before tapping out thank god for alcohol from what i could see that had been boiled in water and the own on a grill no taste what so ever well in fact whatever taste there was was very displeasing to the pallet even the waitress kept walking by and looking at the table but at the end wouldnt even ask if we enjoyed the meal not i really wanted to say something but my wife asked that i not pay the bill and go home for leftovers well in fact this is the longest review i have ever done but this is more a warning to others not to eat hear unless you are training for fear factor bill with tip came to around 90 with tip wasnt her fault but wouldnt return im also being forced to give a star when in fact there shouldnt be one at all|0

fast top notch and reliable window tinting it started with lists friendly voice over the telephone and continued with a welcoming smile when i arrived i came here because of the good ratings same day appointment and the yelp deal e far in did as much as possible to help me out with my vehicle including giving me a great deal to detour me from using my yelp deal unfortunately though due to no error on uw it i had already purchased it and could not get a refund in the end we agreed on using the yd and i got great service and workmanship i was even able to use their wifi and power to charge my i pad all while watching a movie on netflix thanks lisa the only reason for the 4 stars as opposed to 5 is because of the confusion with the yelp deal but i would not hesitate to bring another vehicle back to universe window mobile tint for my tinting needs at all if i can offer potential customers reading this review a wise word please follow these three tips 1 make an appointment at least 2448 hours in advance 2 speak to e far in directly upon arriving he may be willing to help more than yelp 3 avoid the yelp deal bring cash instead|1

cant believe i drove to rum diaries in ajax paid 20 cover and the toilet is too nasty to use all levels of wrong wet floors and toilet paper all over the floor spoke to the manager and they blamed troublesome patrons the manager mans planned that womens washrooms are dirty and that any janitor would agree i womans planned that ive been in far more ladies rooms than him and its up to get to keep it clean he continued that he couldnt understand why women would want to use public restrooms in the first place he also encroached on my space and i told him i did not want to engage him any further ridiculous|0
the office staff is very inconsiderate wait times are ridiculous they wont schedule more than two family members at a time so you haft to make multiple trips the wait times just to be seen are about an hour so plan on spending the day very unhappy we had my sons wisdom teeth removed and we waited 2 hours before being seen once he was finished we got him in the car and we had to go back in because they didnt give him any extra gauze or the prescription for pain meds we had to wait approx 20 min wouldnt that be something you would have together no apologies just act like its no big deal the dry are great which makes it hard to leave however once i find a new great dentist bye|0

although the price was cheap and the location decent i had a terrible experience at the armada do not stay here i did as suggested by other travelers and requested a newly renovated room for a slightly higher price for night the room itself was nice but the walls were paper thin i was kept awake every night because of people talking quietly or watching the to at a low volume in the next room not to mention people yelling and talking outside and i was on the third floor the included continental breakfast was also quite bad the fruit was canned and in syrup there were almost no vegetarian options the biggest issue i had though is one of safety and service the night i checked in i woke up at 4 am to the sound of someone opening my door and trying to enter my room luckily i had locked the security latch so the door would not open completely i heard the door shut and then open again and yelled to the intruder to leave i ran to the door and looked out the peep hole two ladies each holding half finished beers with the remainder of a case between them and seeming intoxicated had key cards with access to my guest room i called the front desk and immediately reported the event and demanded that their keys be confiscated a few minutes later i went to the front desk myself to discuss the situation and explain how scared and upset i was by this incident the woman at the front desk said that a computer glitch had caused my room to appear unused so she assigned it to these ladies in the middle of the night she promised to leave a note about the situation and told me to talk to the manager in the morning she never left the note nor informed any superiors about my mishap i approached the manager the next morning and explained the situation he didnt seem to have much of a reaction to this unsafe and unsettling event but he promised to look into it and asked me a few questions about my checkout date i never heard any followup information from the manager or any staff member even after contacting the company after leaving the hotel the only feedback i ever got was an automated email letting me know i had been enrolled in the armada rewards program which i am still trying to subscribe from nice gesture right|0
what a wonderful place this may be in a few years for future tenants fully expecting most of us to be priced out of here soon enough but for now ive had the privilege of paying full boat for a daily 700am wake up call to listen to a never ending total repaint resurface and reconstruction of the complex the water has gone out half a dozen times this summer and the plumbing drains will periodically regurgitate sewer stank as my properties res sure its this complex alliance ran into the ground you cant totally blame them they are doing the right thing but you cant totally blame current residents for being put out by paying ok a month to rent in an active construction site parking is currently so bad that i have to walk my girlfriend to her car on the other side of the block at night ive had a series of notes on my door this month adding up to where on the very same day i am to expect to be woken up by my parking lot and front office entrance being rebuilt a mandatory yearly inspection plus have my patio furniture and outside storage moved into my unit for painters who im not supposed to be alarmed by when they finally decide to show up at my back glass sliding door apartment living bootcamp isnt fun anymore this all wouldnt be so bad if i hadnt already had maintenance out here a dozen times to get this place to where it should have been when i moved in avoid this place until 2019 where i cant imagine what theyll be charging to recoup reno costs for a 40 year old thin walled 800sq it 1 bed unit|0
service ive never received before the 2 gentleman that assisted me were very professional and courteous i have never received such great service in a long time i went in on a friday around 2 in the afternoon wanting my maserati quattroporte it and may i remind you this is a brand new car worth more than 100000 so you wouldnt just let anyone clean your car but as soon as i gave the keys to the gentleman working i believe his name was abby i left with no stress or concerns worrying about my second wife after a few hours i went downtown had lunch and came back to my car looking better than it ever has the quality of the materials and resources they use are outstanding and i will definitely give my car keys to these guys any time the carpets were clean the outside was spotless with no water marks and the car looked better than ive ever seen it my overall rating is 2010 to this establishment and will definitely bringing back my cars and recommending friends to bring their cars for cleaning and to be taken care of by these 2 hard working men i got the 24900 package and i cant believe the job they did for the price there are also 40 packages to 250 packages also monthly packages that is great if you clean your car often recommend it to anyone who drives just like your real wife your car needs a spa day too highly recommend to anyone who wants a proper job done to their car thanks again guys and will definitely see you again|1

beware this place is a disaster i have never rated anything a 1 star before in my life worst nail experience in my life i cant stress how bad of a job holly the nail tech did on my hand i went in for a full set with my best friend that was visiting town and i did some research and found this adorable little nail salon i usually go to the nail bar in henderson because they do amazing ad nails and designs by hand but they were booked for the weekend so i called pink nails and asked if they do ad nails and the receptionist said they can do anything i can bring a picture of off of google i was extremely excited and looked online and found a cute picture or polka dots and stripes and was looking forward to my appointment and to show off vegas a little bit to my friend we walked in and i showed holly the picture of what i wanted and she immediately said she refused to do it her manager came over and told her just to do it i sat down and she glued the nails on without doing my cuticles and made my fingers bleed i kept my patience until it was time for her to paint them and she once again was being a huge i and refused to do polka dots she said she will do glitter instead again i kept my patience and said okay at this point i dont care what you do she painted a layer of regular nail polish and claimed that it was gel but it clearly stated that it was not i wanted to see how many lies she would continue to tell me before i spoke up after she painted my nails with glitter she took the file and filed down my cuticle area causing it to look like i needed a fill at this point i spoke up and had enough she was giving me a very bad attitude and in the end i paid 70 and my blood is still boiling 4 days later today i went and paid the nail bar in henderson to fix their mistake and ended up paying another 60 they couldnt believe someone could charge me so much for the crappy job they did is they confirmed that the polish that holly said was gel was not gel dont let them scam you|0

do not ever take your car here i went into this location after being told over the phone that they had a brake special of 50 off services that was a lie i take my car in the next day and as i was waiting i overheard a customer telling the men at the front desk her brand new brakes she just purchased and had installed at this meinike were grinding and making an awful noise i should have left then considering i too needed brake service i made the mistake of staying my car is looked at by one of the mechanics who calls my boyfriend and i outside to tell us the quote i see a quote for 997 how brakes and one rotor costs nearly 1000 is beyond me but the quote wasnt the worst part after i clearly disagree with the charges and opt to take my vehicle somewhere else the man proceeds to tell me he will not allow me to drive my vehicle away due to the condition of my brakes and i would have to to i my car off their shop they claim its the law however when i sign a waiver i assume all responsibility of my car and i also make it clear i am aware of the supposed danger of my vehicle mei eke was not abiding by law they were trying to waste my time after i disagreed with their bogus charges obviously they use this tactic as a way to get fools to just stay and have the services done there i didnt and as soon as i said i still did not want brake services done there the nice guy act went out the window they were very rude and condescending to me as i waited for the to i truck to arrive i would never bring my car here again these are not true mechanics they are just a bunch of men who take advantage of unsuspecting people by charging them more money than their services will ever be worth do yourself a favor and never visit this or any other meinike store terrible service and a terrible experience is all you will get when coming here trust me|0

ghetto est 7 eleven ive ever been to and its not just the area im also talking about the employees my sister and i wanted a ice coffee we were headed to the las vegas natural history museum and this was the closet place on our way there so we stop in okay so its people asking for money by the door and men cat calling us on our way inside we specifically went just for ice coffee we get to the machine and theres only one cup left and its a large okay so my sister can get the large and ill go ask the employee if i can get a cup too right so i go to the front and ask if i can get a cup for the ice coffee please the old guy says theyre right there next to the machine as if im wrong and blind no there isnt any more left your e all out the other employee tells him yeah were all out nobody ordered more old guy then tells me use one of them soda or slurpee cups then okay sure i go check on my sis and shes not getting any and i asked whats wrong she says taste this it was disgusting didnt taste anything like the regular coffee they sale and another guy tells them hey your e all out of hot coffee you think you can brew some more and i hear them reply no thats all we got wow bad customer service rude employees and they cant even keep up with running and restocking their store we told them were going to the other one down the street and they just said kay bye now didnt even care how poorly peoples experience was at there store i know how bad the area is and dont expect anything fancy but they can at least try doing their job right that way the place can some what improve going to always skip coming here for sure|0
my husband and i and our two boys have been to the two sister restaurants spokes on southern and boulders on broadway for many years with our two boys and always have felt welcome and had a good experience they are now 10 and 13 and we were looking for a place to dine tonight with a great beer selection good food and a pool table boulders on southern seem to fit the bill and we were all excited for our monthly night out our service and food were good and our waitress did a fine job getting us what we needed but we were disappointed with the spa selections we told our boys that they were not going to play electronics tonight so they had fun playing the board games available instead when we finished our meal we headed over to the pool table and dart area although i do not feel my boys were disrespectful or misbehaving they were approached at least 5 times by the manager telling them they were doing something wrong my husband and i are the types that dont mind adults correcting our kids and i feel the manager approached them in an appropriate way so i didnt think much about it the first few times we just reminded them of the rules were playing with them and told them that if any adults were waiting we should give up the games by the fourth or fifth time they were approached none of them warranted in my opinion i was frustrated and wanted to go home i had to ask several times for a check and to get my license back from the dart deposit i am just frustrated with society everyone is so easy to judge i phone use at restaurants and overuse of electronics by kids but when you let them do anything else people seem to judge and be little them i dont get it and i dont think its fair to treat families this way when they are trying to enjoy your restaurant i feel my boys are like any others at this age they may not be perfect but i feel we have raised them right and that they werent doing anything to deserve the treatment they received so i can not recommend this as a family friendly restaurant and in the future i will just stick to gilbert restaurants that almost always seem to welcome kids and families i really wanted to love this place and was hoping we could visit with our kids again in the future i dont believe this will happen but i hope they can make some opinion changes about children in the future based on this review|0
worst customer service and staff i wish it gave the option for customers to give this place a negative 5 stars because of the extreme lack of respect and care the staff and manager have for their customers simply speaking they do not know how to run a proper business and will scam you taking your 200 deposit they will make any possible sad little excuse that they can come up with in order to keep your money even when there has been no damage done to the room i have never wrote a bad review but i am truly disgusted and want to save anyone else who want to spend the night here to go someplace else i wish i read the reviews before going here because as you can see every review posted on here is negative and so many others have had horrible experiences you can also check out other review pages online where hundreds of people have complained about the same thing google reviews tripadvisor and expedite are just a few of the many sites with numerous horror stories of vulnerable customers who unfortunately chose this place you can get a nice suite at a hotel elsewhere for 270 where staff will accommodate you to the best of their abilities and put their customers satisfaction first rather than coming here as they will not return your 200 damage deposit a week passes by and still no deposit back into my account i call on two different occasions to ask about this and they tell me to wait it will be returned knowing damn well that they werent returning anything so i personally went back to this place two weeks following my stay to ask to speak to the manager to get answers as to why my 200 deposit was never credited back to my account the lady at the front desk told me the manager was not in at the moment i explained my frustration and confusion yet she paid zero attention extremely rude lady continues to stare at her computer monitor acting as if she was occupied with something else and absolutely no eye contact giving a fuck about my disappointment i continue to explain that they were simply stealing from customers and have no proof of damage therefore i will call the cops as soon as i mention cops the lady immediately calls her manager and her manager comes right out wait what i thought she wasnt in ha ha what a joke and the manager was of course as expected no more help than the lady at the front desk learn to run a damn business with genuine care for your customers rather than stealing 200 from everyone that walks in the door who will not be returning customers in order to run the place its honestly just sad do not ever go here|0

most asian food i have in madison just makes me miss the food in la and sadly the pho at viet house is no different the pho at viet house is better than saigon noodles or any other vietnamese place ive been to in town but i felt that the broth couldve been more flavorful the amount of rice noodles couldve been more generous however their barn mi is delicious i had the grilled pork barn mi and it was exactly what i had hoped it would be their grilled pork barn mis didnt include any pate but i usually ask for them to leave it out anyway ive also had their spring rolls which typically are non fried wrapped with rice paper i found them to just be average the egg rolls are fried but they were a disappointment they shouldve came with lettuce and basil and herbs to wrap the egg rolls with but instead all we got were just the egg rolls on a plate with some pickled carrots as garnish ive been there three times now and twice my meal was ruined by the waitress it was the same waitress who was surprisingly incompetent both times we had asked her specifically whether the egg rolls came with lettuce and she said yes then when it came without any lettuce we asked for some and she seemed confused by the request also both times in the middle of me taking a bite of my food and enjoying my meal she stops by and asks whether i am finished it ruins my meal every time i rather no service than incompetent service come here anyway just get the barn mi to go|1

can i give zero stars had something dry cleaned there and the item was returned to me with a rip in it i asked for them to replace the item and they said they could fix it the fix was shoddy at best and did nothing to actually repair the item after pushing the issue they only returned the money i had spent on the actual dry cleaning service and this was only after fighting with the manager multiple times and being called names by her extremely unprofessional|0
i went to this dentist for a wisdom tooth extraction when i came in i was told that the procedure would be relatively straight forward and i was given a price quote my appointment was for up but i sat in an empty room from 215pm to up when do pant az i finally arrived he was yelling at his assistant while stabbing my mouth with the freezing needle once the procedure began his bantering continued as he began cracking my teeth and jamming his instruments inside my mouth while i was told the procedure would be straightforward i ended up being in the chair for about 3 hours it was so long that do pant az i ended up taking a coffee break midway through he was also sure to mention how much he wanted to be going home the whole time i was in the chair very reassuring when the procedure was finally finished i came to the front desk where they informed me that they has misquoted my price and it was actually about 50 more per tooth i suspect they did this because it took so long and they knew i had no use of mouth to argue with them post procedure care was ok but they tried to send me home with just some advil i had to insist on proper pain medication and the doctor eventually wrote me a prescription the story concludes with me booking an appointment to get a regular dental check up a month or so later my appointment was scheduled but i had to travel to the us unexpectedly and since i was out of country i wrote an email using the email address they told me i could use and list on their website informing them of my situation and that i wanted to reschedule of course they did not check their email and proceeded to keep calling me at my canadian phone number for confirmation when i received the messages finally i was prepared to pay the 50 missed appointment fee until i received this reply on my email from do pant az i himself hi as far as i remember we called you not emailed you so common courtesy is to call us back not email thats like after you email us ill reply to you by snail mail so please keep your blackberry for texting and replying messages sent to you in the same form and by the way looking for a new dentist do alan pant az i totally classless and unprofessional im looking for that new dentist and so should you not recommended|0

small store that is a cross between a local grocer and a wholesaler everything a small family would need from a store with a fairly large selection for the size also a good place to find some deals if you dont mind buying in bulk for example i buy coz styrofoam cups for our coffee tea and they are cheaper here than anywhere else i have looked they also carry boxes of breakfast sausage patties from a company called rudy i that are restaurant quality ample parking and they are right next to a dollar tree the parking lot is adjacent to teds hot dogs if you like grilled red white hot dogs you have to try teds|1
my husband and i moved from the toledo ohio area to madison last year one of our biggest concerns was that we were going to miss all of the fantastic pizza places that we frequented in ohio you would not believe how incredibly ecstatic we were when we realized that there was a marcos pizza in sun prairie marcos pizza was founded in toledo ohio so i feel as though we can speak to how great this location is in comparison this location is wonderful and marcos pizza in general is great we normally pickup our pizza and drive home with it even after the 25 minute drive the pizza is still great the sandwiches are also fantastic|1

i agree with much of what tara i has to say my favourite things about the com i it has shade regardless of stage youll find a place thats not sunny also the beer gardens are next to a stage so you can enjoy live music while enjoying sangria wine or beer also the shelton suites calgary eau claire hotel is about a 4 minute walk away for out of owners or for downtown folks who want to really enjoy the entirety of the festival also the festival organizers has people walking around with water tanks filling up the bottles of anyone who needs water how awesome is that one thing that troubles me greatly however is how we are forced essentially to run a gauntlet of food vendors on our way from the front gates to the main stage its overcrowded when its busy and its just not fun but thats greatly outweighed by the many good things this festival brings give it a try its worth your time and money|1

oh yes the eiffel tower drink my buddy and i each got a pina colada in an eiffel tower which contained a huge amount of alcohol the bartender who was a very friendly guy poured a whole ton of liquor in and blended it up to make one i didnt realize all that liquor would only be for one of us wow walking around with a gigantic eiffel tower with a straw sticking out will get you some looks but not in a bad way also we both realized the same thing it goes down very easy and seems weak until the base of the tower when it all just hits you almost instantly have fun 1699 for the eiffel tower with that much liquor hell of a deal on the strip|1
for years now ifs a has been a thorn in my side and im sick of the way ive been treated there though ive gone through the proper channels to file complaints over and over im treated as an invalid or outright ignored and i want it to stop heres the complaints i have about your very unprofessional organization starting about four years ago ifs a knowingly ran me into debt with them or they are just that incompetent they sent me checks with no money to back it and i cashed them not knowing this when they were the only ones who could see my account balance i had no access to it never had then they blamed me for running them into debt when it wasnt within my control at all for months i was paying them back for their own mistake i asked to become my own payee i had to get the paper work by myself i set up an appointment like they said to get it signed then it turns out the doctor i saw couldnt sign it even though i was specifically told she could i was told to make another appointment with another doctor that appointment was rescheduled at least 3 times and twice without them informing me they also wrote down that i had showed up to those appointments a therapist there jane harvey had communications with my ex girlfriend through email when the girlfriend was not even living in the same city any more i saw the emails told her i would go print them and then magically they were gone signifying that she tipped off my ex to delete them for the past 4 years or so ive been disregarded pushed aside and treated with utter disrespect the organization couldnt find its own butt with two hands and a flashlight if i can find a way to take legal action i will as it stands now i am going to badly review it in every public spot that i can no one should be patronizing ifs a i dont care how non profit it is they are crappy to their clients most of whom are mentally challenged so they are probably robbing them blind but not me ive had enough i have since moved out of state they are aware of this very aware because they dragged me through a crap load of red tape to do it i need to talk to someone there to help transfer information here no one will answer my calls or respond to them even though ive left several messages and sent emails i think the problem here is 99 of their clients are mentally challenged to a point where they need supervision im not i am very aware of what they are doing the rampant incompetence and the fact of the matter is they are probably robbing those more mentally disabled people blind and they cant see it because they lack the ability my heart goes out to them because this organization is horrible|0

the experience i had with this business was horrifying first of all harold talked down our jewellery like it was trash but he seemed awfully interested in it we are not idiots the two rings we wanted to sell were not great and they were not trash they were middle of the road and we had realistic expectations when we entered harold so after he took possession of our rings he immediately got on his cell phone he remained on and off his cell phone for the entire hour we were basically held hostage in his back room whenever we tried to negotiate the phone magically rang he screamed at his wife he yelled at every single person he talked to the conclusion i could draw was that he doesnt respect a single person he talked to on that day in the middle of this nonsense a group of men came in obviously harold didnt like the looks of them because he locked up the cages and made them talk to him through bars even as they could plainly see us sitting comfortably at his desk he talked to them like they were scum and in the end there was no transaction completed finally he came back to us at that point i wanted the rings back and to get out of there asap he refused to offer a fair price so we took the rings back at which point he treated us like we were in the wrong for not taking his price he was rude arrogant and pretty much mean id never do business with harold the jewellery buyer even if he was the last gold buyer in toronto this experience is the mark by which i measure all bad customer service and i have yet to have another experience reach the pinnacle of bad experiences that this instance did please do yourself a favour and avoid this place at all costs|0

i have been coming back here a few time since and each time its been slightly worst my recent visit was the top that has convince me im not going back to this restaurant i generally have a lot of tolerance for rude service even though i really shouldnt we went to the restaurant on a saturday and it was busy i did expect it to be slow as usual but not rude first strike for me i asked to sit at the back table and they told me no because it was busy we had a party of 4 and the table accommodated 5 anyhow not long after we sat down someone else known to the staff came in a party of 2 and sat where i had requested to sit and strike generally you get kimchi soya beans as starters but this time we didnt so i asked for it the first person said they will bring it but never arrived ord strike when i asked another wait staff she said do i look like i have kimchi we dont have any its too busy the food which is really why i am tolerant did finally came but it was not good everything was under seasoned had no taste the dumplings skin was too doughy and thick|0

made a special trip to the gallery for the first time yesterday and arrived around 1230pm to our surprise there was a handwritten sign on the door that read out to lunch will be back at up online as well as the standard business hours on the door did not indicate that the gallery closes for the lunch hour we waited and waited along with another group of people that arrived around the same time as us it was eventually up with no sign of an employee to open the gallery 110 115 still nothing the other group of people decided to leave after waiting for almost an hour eventually around 130pm a lady walked up to the gallery opened the door and removed the sign no apology or anything she completely ignored the fact that we were waiting for her and well beyond the time she said she would be back frustrating and definitely not worth the wait|0
we came all the way from florida to attend this food and wine affair it was amazing i had never been to this type of event before so i didnt have a point of reference but this was a at the be lag gio it stands to reason it was amazing we opted to buy the early admission meaning we got to come in an hour earlier than general admission the friend who organized this trip suggested we do this frankly for my part i didnt need it im a pretty small person so i get full very quickly i was full before the hour was up price wise i believe the difference is substantial but i dont remember quite well anyway i would up just walking around waiting for my food to go down next thing i know it was 20 minutes before closing i didnt drink a lot either my bad though there was plenty to eat and drink the food i did try was great lots of tuna tartare in any way you can imagine there was lots of sea food not a lot of dessert which was a little disappointing a booze infused ice cream and firefly had some dessert as well everything was so good though would i do it again not in vegas i would try somewhere i dont have to buy a flight and hotel lol south beach or palm beach i now have a point of reference and its a pretty high bar to reach|1
i am 8 weeks pregnant and i came in to have a heartbeat scan done i went back to the room laid down and had gel placed on my belly and waited as she performed an abdominal ultrasound to see my baby after about 3 minutes she said she could not find the baby but shed continue looking kept looking kept searching no baby are you sure your e pregnant she asked yes i replied how far along did you say you were she asked 8 weeks through the entire 15 minute ordeal she went on to say she couldnt find the baby and that may be i had a false positive or was earlier along than i thought because there was no baby that she could see she even joked that another lady was relieved when she wasnt actually pregnant was she implying that may be i would be too i wanted to cry but i didnt i had brought my 2 and 3 year old along to go and look at the new baby and was afraid i might scare them or make them uncomfortable i was definitely embarrassed and just slightly devastated that she could not find it and was even telling me that i may have had a false positive i held on to the fact that she said she wasnt a healthcare provider and that may be i was earlier along than i thought she slightly discounted the fee of 60 to 40 and said if i went to my doctor and found the baby and wanted to come back she would discount the service it felt like i was holding my breath the entire trip to the grocery store to buy a two pack of tests and i didnt release until i came home and got that plus sign whoo hoo im still pregnant i then scolded myself for even worrying that much what did she know i thought but then what was wrong why wasnt she able to see it how far along am i really so i called my friend ashley who is 5 months pregnant and a registered nurse and asked what she thought she explained that she should have done a transvaginal ultrasound because until about 10 or 11 weeks a baby is not visible on an abdominal one shouldnt the tech have known that why would she offer ultrasounds that early if she wasnt going to do it correctly may be the tech doesnt get women this early that often but the whole experience was scary and unnerving and i would recommend that anyone under 10 weeks not go or ask if she performs transvaginal ultrasounds before you make your appointments it could save your heart from dropping when she tells you she cant find the baby nice lady but a little misinformed|0

this place has a lot of history it was originally called ma heller i so people started calling is mas for short then in a misguided eff fort to make it hip it was switched to man not sure how old it is but i do know it was open when the boys came back from wwe and it did well serving steaks and featured live music on my last visit home i took a friend from it louis with me and i described it to him as a dive bar he then corrected me to say it wasnt a dive bar but rather a joint i believe he was right this place gets 5 stars because it is a landmark and should be preserved so i can go back for a few beers every couple of years one piece of advice the drunks at this place are harmless but they will talk your ear off if you let them|1

i had a basement drain clog i first tried a heavily advertised local plumbing service that company did not fix the problem instead they poorly reassembled the pipes and said it would require digging up part of the basement they billed me for this hour or so of labor i called frank later and he came over the same day he fixed the shoddy craftsmanship he also tried for another hour to fix the underlying issue which he did not bill me for he clearly explained what was wrong and gave a simpler cost effective bid to solve the issue that did not require digging he communicated professionally throughout the whole process and came the next week which he completed that day the drain has been gurgling along great since i am impressed by franks direct professional working demeanor and quality work|1
this review is specific to the pharmacy and its unfortunate because everyone back there was kind and answered questions except the one woman who made me cry yes a pharmacist made me cry she through away my coupon and said it wasnt valid and when i asked her to get it out of the trash so i could look at it she rolled her eyes once i got it back i looked it over and realized there was no expiration on it so how was it not valid she apparently just didnt feel like applying my valid coupon aside from that she was just downright rude i dont pretend to be a pharmacist or know everything so i ask questions its her job to help me i am pulling all of my prescriptions from there solely based on her everyone else behind that counter was fantastic i wish i had gotten names|0

located between atwater and concord la maison bul goi is easily accessible having been to most of the korean restaurants downtown i decided to give this one a shot the decor is very old fashioned and it would probably need renovations the place was almost empty when we came for dinner if your e looking for authentic korean food then this place isnt it the menu is very extensive and had a mix of everything but the food itself wasnt too great we ordered the kimchi pancake which was bland oily and didnt have enough kimchi the bibi mba i average in size and taste and what else the bul goi for a place called la maison bul goi i expected the meat to be good but it was overcooked and way too oily the staff was also rather unprofessional and did not fill our water even once for the one hour and half we stayed portions are average and on the pricey side overall i wouldnt go again|0
my appointment was at 430 the door was locked when their website states they close at up anyways so we finally get started at 500 plate i brought two bundles of hair i have really thick hair so it requires a bundle and a half so i used their atm to pull out 120 for them to do the 49 sew in they offer the price went up to 74 because i wanted it flat ironed told her to keep the change 15 min later she says oops i forgot to give you your change lol i responded i told you to keep it she didnt thank me at all i just tipped her 46 before she even did my hair ungrateful the lady i had this day was so slow on her phone texting and answering calls after two hours she stops and told me after she added the braids that she was going to have to stop and work on the other lady that had been waiting two hours to get her hair even started the manger i said that it would only take 3045 min and he would tell the stylist that i was in a hurry as well he never did i told her that i had dinner at 730p if she could just have me done asap thank god she never helped i the other lady there was another hair stylist there working on her anyway she was taking so long i had to cancel my dinner plans its now 630p my hair looked horrible she only used about 80 of one pack of hair and even told her my hair is thick when i sat in her chair she stops after the fact and tells me my hair is too thick after she did the sew in and calls her sup on what to do lol i asked her repeatedly to put at least a full pack of hair in she took the hair out and started over at this point im trying so hard not to lose my damn mind hair wasnt blended nor flat ironed yet during this time she is telling me on what to ask for next time i come in so its done the way i want i told her that i just wanted the hair put in she said because she needs to double the hair that it would be more she probably said that twice to me as if i couldnt afford it or something i told her i would pay whatever i needed to walk out of there i what i was looking for the first two times i had my hair done here in total ive spent close to 600 so money isnt the issue so she removes the hair and some braids re added more braids and starts reinstalling the hair since doubling the hair weft will be 5 more per bar braid i told her i gave her 120 to take it from that she stops and tells me that all she has is the 6 i gave her for a tip ugh no i gave her 120 i have no pockets no purse on me so i didnt lose it and i know that i gave it to her literally half my head is done and she leaves again to call her sup i on what to do counts the drawer tells me the drawer is only 14 over plus the 6 you gave me we dont want you thinking we are trying to pull one over on you lol i told her to please just finish my hair just in case i wouldnt be done in time i told my someone to bring me my clothes etc time is still passing and getting close to the second part of my plans that evening about 830p now i told her i had tickets to see a show humanity at 930p she finally finished my hair i swear she had to call her sup at least 5 different times possibly more asking what to do with all these minor situations i told her i would pay for whatever needed to be done she didnt finish my sew in till 837p i didnt even have time to go home fix my own hair shower or get ready for the rest of my night i had to put a hat on to hide what she had done and get ready in my car shitty thing is she didnt blend it flat iron nothing thank god i had someone bring my clothes because i wouldve been late to the show and my friend had been waiting for me over an hour now i felt so bad the worst thing about this appointment is the fact i could hear the supervisor owner i talk shit about me he was loud and she was right next to me laughing at the shit he was saying i was cool the whole time lol i found a new hair stylist in henderson she will be fixing this mess on monday|0

great roof but damaged our home in the process and wont come back to fix it they removed historical siding and moulding and replaced with sheet metal which they spray painted to match our house caused our electrical panel to become unbolted from our house and its now hanging off the wall with the inside of the wall exposed the original siding and moulding was thrown away by the roofers and when i called to speak with robin at the office she informed me that we should have alerted them to the importance of the siding and moulding this company has a great bob rating and im not sure how and has worked on historic homes before so i dont know why wed need to let them know that our siding and moulding shouldnt be torn off thrown away and covered up with the possibility of rain this monday we now need to figure out a way to keep our electrical panel from getting rained on or letting rain into the wall they have no sense of urgency in getting our repairs done and the only way we can talk to them is to call or email over and over they dont call back when they say they will and dont care that they discarded parts of our house that are historically significant|0

this is the worst service and the nastiest people i have ever encountered i went in to change a broken i phone screen and paid 70 bucks within the first 3 days and without ever dropping the phone it cracked the frame around the glass was in perfect condo on confirming that the phone was never dropped when i went back to the store and showed them the defective screen i was told that they could not help me and the manager never came out to try to help me they then insulted me by saying that they would give me 3 dollars for the frame because it can still be reused this is a bunch of guys that just rip off their customers dont waste your money on these scam artist|0
i have been getting my hair did and going to salons almost all my life i have to say hands down this was my absolute worst salon experience ever nightmares included girls ya know what i mean i have to agree with alex is past review when she said funny their slogan is to go over and beyond because they couldnt have tried less alex i hear ya chick and for sure very much feel your pain but for the ones out there that dont need a support group and now a wig theres still time for you you can save your hair and also a ton of money by just staying away from this place however if you do decide to enter this salon of hell make sure while in that chair you agree with everything that is said like a damn is housewife do not voice opinions on your hair god forbid ask anything about products being used oh and its normal protocol to get yelled at like a child but hey some people like these things my personal experience was a color gone wrong they did acknowledge the color was wrong i mean they had eyes they being owner gail and stylist danielle bradshaw danielle started yelling at me like a mental patient off anger management meds she just kept looking up at the ceiling saying 5 times literally all i wanted was it to be fixed gail did end up fixing it since danielle was just crazy but she wanted her money she didnt care if it came out 2 different colors she wanted her money she just kept yelling it i just wanted to pay gail i fees not danielle i as well what sense did that make 26400 gail made me pay it to i tried not to but she literally called the cops and when they got there they told me to pay or get arrested gail swiped my card twice and took almost 600 for an all over color no hair cut no style so yeah i would stay far far away from this salon|0

love it amazing staff very nice enjoyed my time here and yummy bob a tea marco is the man|1
writing this review is a struggle two stars is a bit harsh three stars a bit generous its not that this place is bad but given toronto i current obsession with craft beer and local breweries its pretty disappointing heres why the place itself could use a rethink from a design perspective it just feels cold and devoid of any character i think someone else noted this in their yelp review previously the guys working were nice enough but for some reason during the entire night we seemed to be in a blind spot we were seated at the 4 top by the door the server would literally walk to the tables surrounding us on all 3 sides the ith side being the door and bypass us at best the brewery was hard full at its peak so no idea what the deal was we ordered some appetizers to share which consisted of the cheese and charcuterie platter and some pickled eggs the cheese was good but the charcuterie was cut in such massive thick slices that i just couldnt eat it i know some people like this rustic style but its just not for me as its way too much chewing and gets stuck in your teeth beer wise they have an ok selection but nothing stood out that would make me go out of my way to return and i actually dont recall if they had anything exclusive to them overall my experience reflected the quality and level of service in different would i return shrugs shoulders would they care if we did probably not|0
id been to bacchanal several times in years past it was tons of fun good food and an outstanding atmosphere belly dancing live music and the best part you can break plates so i planned my boyfriends birthday dinner to be there last night i called 2 weeks ago to make the reservation for 15 people i called again on tuesday oct 25 to confirm they said see you then when my party of 15 arrived to a dark deserted parking lot we were perplexed and i was embarrassed a big pink sign tacked to the door explained sorry we are closed for problems forced the remodeling oct 25 31 which begs the questions if the restaurant was already closed on oct 25 why did they confirm my reservation when i called oct 25 and why didnt they call me to cancel my reservation im seriously disappointed and sad that a place i would once have given 5 stars is now barely worthy of 1|0

a big storm with smile winds left us with a very large silver maple with a cracked trunk and big limb over a neighbors fence we called 8 different tree companies and many were slow about calling us back or never did the owner mike called back and even stopped by that day unlike many companies that emailed us higher estimates than they verbally quoted us mike wrote out an estimate on the spot johnson tree service gave us an quote for 2700 interesting since the highest quote we received was 4800 its also worth noting that most companies charged 300 for stump grinding but johnson tree service quoted us for 150 for the stump the crew got here early to set up and then had to wait for the me person to cut the power since a big limb was directly over a neighbors powerlines and close to a transformer during the entire 5 hours that it took the entire crew was working hard i think it also speaks well of a company when the owner is getting dirty and working alongside his crew they got the job done and they made sure to give us an itemized bill for our insurance claim some people expect everything to be perfect when taking down a tree if so you might not like little things like host as getting covered with mulch or grass getting stomped down the thing is this was a big job and im not going to sweat the small things i was more worried about protecting my neighbors yard since they had to drive their big machines through their yard and we already inconvenienced the neighbors by taking out their power for two days johnsons heard my concerns and were really good about laying down planks so that my neighbors lawn wasnt torn up they also used a blower to clean up all the leaves in the yard even though most of them were not from the tree they were taking down all in all i highly recommend johnson tree service and will call them first if we ever need tree help|1
lovely salon they know their cuts and colours well would definitely recommend gordon is an amazing cutter but hesitate to post that as i want to still be able to get in to see him every cut i have had by gordon looks good from the day i walk out of the salon until 23 months later when i return it grows out beautifully|1

while i was living in kuwait i went to a spa every 3 weeks to get my nails done when i first went the nail tech explained to me that she sculpted gel nails and did not use tips and acrylic i said sure ill try it and ive been in love with it ever since fast forward to me coming back to the states and not being able to find one person to do my nails the way that i had grown to like i was devastated i being an avid facebook user befriended a woman here in las vegas by way of a common interest and noticed that her nails were always beautiful one day i couldnt take it anymore and asked her where she got her nails done and she told me and gave me the number after telling me that the wait was at least 6 weeks long i was crushed but i called and spoke to is sasha and she told me about what she does and instructed me that her new clients always started off on a clean slate for 3 weeks my hands nails looked a hot mess because i was determined to get my nails done by her for my birthday i have been with her ever since that wait was well worth it she is a true professional of her craft and her gift speaks for itself because no matter how i get my nails done i always get compliments her work is pure talent love and perfection and she does her own nails which will make you drool because her designs and technique are beyond reproach her consideration for all of her clients and dedication to her skill makes me selfish with her so much so i wont recommend her to anyone in my family lol what i dont want their nails looking as great as mine do overall shes the best and you will not be disappointed unless your e a i it picky micromanaging know it all just let her do what she does enjoy the conversation cause theyre always funny relax and let the best nail tech in las vegas work her magic|1

i had enjoyed shopping at chat nam for 9 years until recently they used to have friendly employees that provided great service but lately thats all changed now there are always two of the laziest and most incompetent female employees on the face of the earth in the store every time i go in one looks like she might be hispanic and the other is some stupid looking person with multi colored hair they never greet customers or offer assistance when they know your e standing there waiting for them the stupid looking one with the multi colored hair just stands there texting on her phone and the other just stands there staring into space until you physically go get her a bad economy shouldnt result in poor service beauty warehouse does more business than chat nam and they provide much better service|0

i was dismayed to find out that in booking my office had prepaid the tip the receipt forwarded didnt say that so i wound up tipping the driver too he never mentioned this and when i called to complain the company was well you should have known meanwhile the driver got way more tip than deserved he checked his phone while driving held in two hands while using his wrists to steer albeit a short time but still on a highway and he was a serial tailgate car was fine the driver courteous but certainly nothing to merit a double tip so beware when you book and dont bother to try to get the company to care bow still waiting day 3 for a detailed receipt and survey to be sent him guess they dont want to hear from me again|0
relatively pricey too much rice and not enough actual filling or too much veggies especially carrots with little space left for the good stuff but it was made fast and everything was fresh so not all bad|0

i was very upset with what i saw today an employee named michael gave me a coz drink instead of a coz drink for my cookies and drink meal and a few people after me went to order what he wanted and asked for a water cup and filled it with lemonade and michael yelled at him for doing that he told him to never come back the guy was black and a construction worker with what sounded like an african accent and was struggling with understanding english this was discrimination and i hope this employee gets fired before i sue this encounter happened at around 1055 and i hope that they review the film of this incident as well|0

i have to agree with eric is review after two visits over the last two years i have been given three referrals by do barres and im young with healthy eyes according to a subsequent optometrist i went to i found do barres spent a lot of time going on and on and on about what a great optometrist he is and how other doctors have commented that he is able to detect conditions more frequently than any other optometrist they know and so on and so on do barres referred me to a chiropractor because after he asked whether or not i get headaches and i responded yes occasionally he determined that i had an unusual head alignment which needed treatment the chiropractor he referred me to then proceeded to call me several times after i didnt return his call i decided my occasional headache was less annoying then the aggressive chiropractor that i had been referred to i found the staff completely unhelpful as well do barres determined i needed glasses for the first time ever he said that i needed glasses to legally drive which was subsequently disputed by another optometrist when he lead me out to the front to look at glasses the sales agent asked where would you like to start having never worn glasses before i found this to be completely unhelpful and went somewhere else where they actually provided some guidance i would be suspicious of any referral given by do barres and for those of you who dont know doctors make money from referrals|0

very low budget dry cleaner i would only recommend this place if you dont care about your clothes but if that was the case you i probably be washing them yourself thus do not go here one of my shirts came back with a gummy substance on the collar yuck and my sweaters came back with safety pins in the sleeve to hold the service tag not acceptable little holes like that lead to rips most dry cleaners put those tags through the recommended wash tag etc to avoid ruining the garment i will definitely not be going back here|0

i found dora elegant events from the phoenix wedding expo i loved her centerpieces and flower arrangements so when it came down to choosing i simply knew i wanted it to be her although dora is very sweet her professionalism organization and communication skills are not on point for a bride these are necessities in order for everything to run smoothly and lets face it you dont need any added stress when i would call dora she wouldnt answer or call me back she never was on time and on the wedding day she said she would be back to finish setting up and never did everything came together because i had other vendors and friends family to help but i am very disappointed in the overall service provided even though i loved her work i can not give her a good review|0

i am extremely surprised to see only 3 star reviews and under my husband and i have been coming to sushi sonora for 2 years now and let me tell you that we love this place i am such a frequent costumer that the cooks already know me and if theres anything thats important about a restaurant is that its clean and this establishment is clean you can see how the cooks prepare the food which in my opinion is important the manager here is really professional and iv never seen a customer treated with disrespect i know the sushi are 10 and over but honestly you get a meals worth if you get a cielo mar y tierra you get 12 sushi slices the crab mix and carrots chipotle and some sort of black sauce and a jalapeno for 11 and its delicious the cooks here are very fast but take out can be a bit of a bummer since the waitresses here are the only down fall in all honesty iv had them forget my order twice and i had to remind them i did not make a big deal about it because i understand its not easy to keep track of everything when you have people waiting on you left and right regardless i love this place|1
we have used dna for years and have had uneven service as with most experiences it depends on which tech comes to your home i had one that told me i needed to buy a new ac unit today we didnt its still working fine i had one who told me i had unhealthy levels of ozone we didnt but those were a while back and recently i noticed that they seem to be speeding up their response times and being more customer oriented if i call and leave a message i receive a call back almost immediately thank you carol and a tech arrives within 24 hours i also think that the tech pat is very good i havent met them all of course but he is unfailingly on time courteous and fixes things with a minimum of fuss a clear explanation and no pressure to buy anything i dont really need so yes im a fan|1

great location plenty of parking and plenty of carts their dollar days are my prime time everything is organized and i usually see it clean the shoe section i think could use some improvement most of them are kinda worn out nice purse section tons of clothes to look at and all well organized lots of housewares some furniture staff has always been amazing|1
we had the pleasure of the team taking care of our new rescue cat over the holidays upon our first meeting with sarah and jake they were professional prompt and knowledgeable you could get a real sense for how much they care for animals our meet and greet with them was really thorough and they were eager to answer any of our questions the daily detailed updates we received really put our minds at ease that our cat was getting looked after well we looked forward to these reports which came with snapshots of our cat they are fast communicators super reliable and just kind people also the online system where you can pay and book services makes arranging sitting for our cat so easy would highly recommend|1
this store is well equipped and stocked but the service is so bad its like going in for a colonoscopy you just hate to even think about it and you dread the fact that you have to go in you literally can have the item you need in 10 seconds and wait an additional 10 minutes to check out since leslie took this store over its gotten way worse than it was under ups or whatever it was before ive been here going on three years and have plenty of experience in this store i liked it much better when leslie was across the street alex who has been there forever is a great tech and very helpful but for gods sake get the man some help i order amazon whenever i can stay ahead of the curve and use this place for emergencies only|0
this place is disgusting food was too greasy bland and surprisingly not cheap at all next time i will just go to chipotle for better quality and service i was sick all day thanks to this establishment|0
he clothes are wonderful to keep up with the trends at a very inexpensive budget however just be prepared to deal with the worst customer service ever the fitting room attendants are like stones lacking any kind of personality or social skills the rest of the staff acted like i was bothering them if i needed help finding something and the lady that checked me out was on the phone while she rung up my 380 purchase she messed up on the ringing and had to start all over because she was distracted on the phone i suggested she call the person back so she could concentrate on ringing me up properly and she rolled her eyes there were 4 customers behind me just as angry at her horrible service where are the managers or the corporate people to come in and do a clean wipe out rehire a whole new crew so he can be a good experience and not a horrid one|0
horrible experience they must cater to men because they took advantage of me paid over 40000 for work to have my door locks fixed because they kept jamming one week later doors started acting up again plus car alarm started going off now when i locked the doors i took my car back to brent and he virtually said he couldnt fix it for me and to take my car to the dealership because it was under a recall for the same exact issue i asked him for a refund because he hadnt fixed the problem and he said he doesnt work for free i told him i dont have 40000 just to give away havent resolved this i might have to go to small claims now|0
i was in town for business and had lunch at this local gem inside was nice and casual loved all the menu options from salads to pizzas i had one of the few sandwiches listed chicken avocado sandwich it wasnt what i expected it was more the chicken was very tender and shredded so it was easy to take a bite and not have it fall apart on you the avocado was ripe and paired well the sandwich was huge in size i really enjoyed this meal on the way out i noticed the dessert counter so bad i was full there were so many delicious treats on display may be next time when im in the area i can come back|1
worst apartment complex to ever live in due to the poor management by jeremy wash and nita robles both of them are unethical i am a paralegal who moved out due to the many many issues of this place both of them are dishonest and will stop at nothing this place is run down over grown terrible maintenance issues that never get repaired in a timely manner do not rent here i can not not recommend this place no way no how|0
this place is insanely expensive furniture is literally given to them and they put exorbitant price tags on it the staff isnt helpful at all i struggle to figure out how they call themselves a thrift store when they ask for 1000 for a worn and tattered bedroom set 5 for a knock knack that had been glued together their discounts dont apply to anything other than the junk thats been there for years|0
this place is great i swear if you have a picky eater they will love this im pretty picky myself with hot pots but this changed my perspective of it customer service is fine as heck they are so kind and every few minutes they ask you if you want more broth and if you could buy the strawberry tea buy it it tastes like ummm you ate a piece of heaven|1
this is located inside a small chinese strip mall in richmond hill i ate a cake bought from here and it was amazing i felt like i could have eaten the whole thing it was that good mango chocolate cake mango mousse on chocolate cake price range for this cake was around midst dont worry they have other flavours too ill update if i eat another one from here presentation 55 taste 55 they have swiss rolls single flavored roll or 4 flavors in a box mango green tea vanilla chocolate and the mini ones are soooo good the sponge cake is really moist and not too much cream in the middle macaroons are also sold here in a wide variety of flavours i think we got 10 for 16 bucks the flavours were spot on but the consistency of the macaroons were a little off only reason why this is a 4 star|1
please stay away this limousine service is horrible my wedding pick up and drop off was the worse experience of my life once the driver arrived he was wearing a hat and jeans what limousine drivers wears that for a bridal party venue so un professional they dont even have a legitimate office in parsippany where you can look at the limousine they just tell you look at our website and thats the limousine they dont have pictures of the inside or nothing just one exterior frontal picture the driver had an attitude all the time and looked miserable and granted we did have a 10 passenger limo my brother was not able to ride in the limo because that would be over the 10 people he had to driver all the way to our venue i know that limousine companies can overlook that for one person but this guy was a complete hole when we arrived at the venue they said that they had the wrong credit card on file and they called my husband while he was waiting for me for the first glance photo shoot and they said to provide them again with the credit card info or to ask someone to give them cash what we are in the middle of a photo shoot and now your asking for this we had provided them with a credit card a week before so they can charge it right away just so happened that they never charged it and when they did was when the bridal party was dropped off thats when they realized they had the wrong information they do not know what they are doing over there dont let them ruin your wedding day please|0
as with all mcdonalds i dont like how they dont serve lunch before am i dont like their breakfast items so i will probably not return here|0
i did not have a good experience the hairstylist i was courteous but the end result was not great i asked for lots of volume since i have thin fine hair which i havent gotten trimmed for a few months and asked for a thick side bang after the initial hair dry i asked her to trim the layers more since they were not framing my face and were dragging my face down she was very reluctant but did it same with my bang i was trying to make her cut more but she was opposed to the idea so i let it be the true test for a haircut is always when you wash it after the cut and try to style it yourself i had also asked for a cut which will be good for slightly wavy hair and yes previous hairdressers have done this for me so it is not unusual a haircut needs to take into account the kind of hair the customer has when i washed and styled the bangs were thin and long they got tucked in behind my ear they were that long not what i wanted the layers are start low after my chin so do not frame my face at all overall not happy with the cut i had done lots of research and after a friends recommendation about david had wanted a cut with him however wont be returning to this branch update dec 1 2017 after reaching out to customer service the district manager scheduled a call and offered me a correction i chose the heartland mississauga store and went in to have a correction done by jen i couldnt be happier about this she listened to me and instinctively knew what would look good on me she and i had the same ideas she saw the parts the other hair stylist missed and worked on those the cut also passed my first wash test and i could style it myself easily everyone in my office complimented my look and it has given me an instant boost thanks jen|0

hoped to find a larger tree for our backyard instead of a small young tree the guy who weve worked with there is a jerk and not very helpful if you want a maple or oak not a problem but if you want just the right tree go somewhere else|0
we went here for brunch because there was a ridiculous line at insomnia i had high hopes as soon as i looked at the brunch menu inside was warm and comfortable nice ambience we sat at a comfy table by the window with a view of blood street the waitress was friendly and attentive and the coffee was decent the food was utter garbage i had a boring omelette with dry home fries my partner had eggs florentine with totally solid yolk and watery spinach meal came out to 25 blech i didnt really want to pay i would go back here to drink some beer and may be brave some pub food but never again for brunch it is otherwise a nice place and the service was good they just need a new cook|0
the product and installer were good but thats about where it ended at install there was a mysterious 375 on our bill with no explanation i had to drive over to show him my original invoice because they dont keep any records digitally then they tried to get me to split the difference between what i agreed to pay and what they tacked on turned out their salesperson couldnt do math properly reviews on other sites tell me that im not alone in these experiences as well also when our blinds failed to come in on time and the company didnt know where they were no one bothered to call us when i called them to find out what happened and request i be kept up to date on my delayed order i was told if i called everyone all day i wouldnt get any work done customer service should be part of your job all in all my blinds look nice they really need to improve some core business processes though i wouldnt use them again and would suggest others avoid the headaches i had|0
my husband isnt one to usually complain unlike me my husband is a mild tempered southern gentleman and will ignore sheer ignorance from people me not so much being a jersey girl born and raised i have and will continue to speak my mind especially for ignorance injustice when he went to pickup his laundry after work on 061813 while waiting in line he notice how friendly the counter employee was to the women in front of him but how her demeanor immediately changed upon him reaching the counter to be helped she displayed very poor customer service which is a pet peeve of mine it pissed my husband off but he just paid for his clothes poor customer service included left and said they lost my business newsflash remember pretty women when the sales women treated julia roberts with such disrespect and loathing dont judge a book by its cover you just never know what lays deeper premier cleaners you just lost a customer who was more then able and willing to pay your high prices for dry cleaning just for the convenience but what we wont pay for is sheer rudeness and disrespect in the process if the young lady who worked the counter should read this i dont know if your reason for such poor customer service was due to my husbands skin color lets hope not or you were mad at your boyfriend husband and hated men in general that day regardless of the reason you should always leave your personal drama at the entrance door when dealing with the public or stay in the back away from customers treating your customers equally with human kindness and a smile goes a long way finally must give the young lady who worked the counter when we dropped off our clothes kudos she was very customer service oriented thanks for your professionalism wish you had been there when we picked up thanks is minority wil out|0
i received a new engagement ring yesterday and of course ive been very aware of it and making sure its in pristine condition i brought it in to says to see what bands might look good with it today barbara offered to show me a ring enhancer the kind with two bands that go on either side of the engagement ring so i let her take my ring to put them together to show me before i could say anything she forced my ring into the enhancer after i looked at it i tried to separate them but couldnt get my ring out she grabbed the rings from me and yanked my ring out of the enhancer by holding the main stone and pulling my ring came out but dropped hard against the table i of course immediately checked it over for damage and there was now a huge scratch in the side of my brand new beautiful ring first barbara and her colleague whose name i didnt get insisted it couldnt be their fault because the gold of the enhancer was softer than the platinum of my ring however once i pointed out how new the scratch is and that you can actually see a tinge of the gold they offered to take the ring overnight to have it polished i thought about it but theres no way im letting anyone from that store ever touch anything i own again ill be taking it to a jeweler i trust to get it fixed ill think about sending them the bill but not sure its worth the trouble i walked out of the store heartbroken and near tears what should have been a wonderful day with my new ring is now ruined|0

let me apologize so my office had this thing where we would alternate saturdays we worked and try different bakeries well i decided to go to a donut shop pandemonium donuts decided to double my order and the clerk at the counter acted as though i had canceled coachella because she had to re box donuts honestly the ingredients were awesome but you kiddos are starting a business in the land of cases donuts i felt like i was supporting a science fair project not a donut shop dont want to see this fail because only so many trust fund babies can collect historical documents and complain about taxes in mahone but at the end of the day learn to be courteous|0

our go to delivery pizza place haha its not fancy and the pies arent the best bang for your buck but they are cheaper and delicious and the ingredients are fresh pan ago promises on no mug or additives in their sauces and their shrimp is ocean wise so bravo on those two facts alone a total step above pizza pizza and dominoes in my opinion you can also customize your crust primo vegetarian and biq chicken are our favourites we ordered it two days ago and i am craving them again|1
the building itself is nice the maintenance staff always keeps the building in great shape frankie the concierge is extremely nice and helpful the downfall of this place is the management office lazy and frankly rude staff the manager will promise to look into an issue and followup via email days go by and no response is heard if you dare walk into the office with questions related to rent or moving you get a nice side eye treatment as though your e a nuisance and interrupting their work day wait isnt your job to work with the residents there are tons of similar buildings available or coming online in pittsburgh baum haus eastside bond acts etc i suggest checking them out if you want management that actually values your business|0
i bought my most recent car from nissan of streetsboro in 2011 and had a fairly easy experience so i went back to look into upgrading yesterday the sales associate we worked with dave rican was incredibly nice and we enjoyed working with him however when it came time to negotiate the purchase price of the vehicle we were interested in the sales manager matt edmond was downright rude and condescending based on his hard sell right out of the gate ill never do business with this place again someone really needs to remind this guy that he works in sales and part of his job is customer service there are plenty of other dealerships in the area that treat customers with respect so theres no reason to give this place your business|0
hula annex is amazing for so many reasons 1 instructors are knowledgeable and experienced whether or not each and everyone is your cup of tea i like that there are a variety of teachers some that lean toward alignment based ankara others that prefer to honour the heart and body with gentle flows and others that will get you sweating bullets as a long time student of hula annex ive sampled many of the classes and take each one for what it is consider that youll love some classes more than others which may depend on the teacher or their sequence and may be it has a little to do with how you came to your mat that day each of the teachers have very different personalities and styles and thats awesome some youll instantly adore and others might shake you up a little thats okay 2 they have amazing workshops darren rhodes noah maze elena broker these people are amazing in addition hula has workshops going on consistently if your e looking to deepen your asana practice meditation practice or life practice 3 they take yoga off the mat may be you do yoga for the sole purpose of fitness thats fine but theres so much more to this practice than getting in shape and hula knows that you need not look further than their website to get a little more information about their positive space initiatives they have an anti oppression committee consent cards inclusive change room signs gender neutral change pod brown girls yoga queer yoga 4 they make yoga more accessible yoga is mostly expensive hula offers a ton of 8 classes that are taught by the same amazing teachers that teach regularly priced classes 8 when i was a student and really needed the stress relief these sort of initiatives let me practice in addition you can attend on friday evenings and receive free childcare while your e in class lastly christian the studio director is awesome her classes are based on a vast amount of experience both as a teacher and student in terms of the running of the studio it seems to be quite collaborative and reflective of the community i think hula is doing a great job as a community leader a changemaker and as a place of asana mindfulness instruction wish i could be there more|1

one of the weirdest least friendly vets i have ever been to and having travelled across the country several times with a cat i know what i am saying the receptionist was very stoic and not friendly but may be she was having a bad day but then the person who handled my cat we got her nails trimmed made the cat howl and cry like i have never heard before this is a gentle easy going people loving cat too we checked and the cat was not bleeding but they must have cut it so painfully close i would not go back i did not see either of the vets so i can only comment on the staff|0

i work with quite a few real estate agents as an owner of a home inspection company i can say heather werner at ravenwood is a caliber above most taking care of clients and the details of their trans ction is where she excels she has the knowledge base skill and expertise to handle the most trying of times and the most difficult transactions i definitely want her on my side when buying or selling a home i would not want to go through the process without her|1
agree with previous posters order the same thing again and it will taste different they are so inconsistent here also they always seem to be running out of items like cups lids and even some ingredients for the juice they are also extremely slow here so dont think your e going to stop by for a quick juice on your way to work i think these guys would be a lot busier if they got it together but for right now a casual attitude and poor attention to quality and service means that they will only be successful until a more competent competitor opens up shop|0
i have gone to this place a handful of times over the past few months because its super close to where i live unfortunately the experience has been horrible i started going somewhere else but today i only had a little bit of time and i said hey let me give this place one more try before i write them off for good lucky for me this place is under new management as of a week ago and i had a great experience the place is in a great location and now that new management has taken over i will continue to go back|1
first let me say that my boyfriend got a hamburger and stated that it was the best burger hes ever had the fries were great and it was all very fresh it was huge and filling with a nice roll the chef cooked it to perfection so for all that why the 1 star rating well everything else is the reason there was no excuse for the outdated and dilapidated interior the drinking glasses that were badly chipped that wont come clean should have been thrown out years ago and no excuse for the dirty cook top the salad i got didnt taste good and the dressing was bitter the dressing was also served in a plastic cup and was not homemade the sign says home cooking but it clearly isnt because if it was they would take the time to make their own dressings i asked which soup was fresh and the waitress said none none of the soup was fresh daily and she couldnt give me a date as to when it was made it was also microwaved and had hot and cold spots microwaved soup in a diner why it was spilling over the bowl and partially burnt on the side yuck she never once asked me how my meal was but stared at me the whole time so i think she knew something was up my advice gut the place start over please get rid of all the dishes and glassware and start over sell your burgers upgrade your salads make your dressings fresh make your soup fresh daily i guarantee then you will be the busiest place in town talk to your staff in the back about business not on the floor in front of guests may be they are going for greasy spoon but its not good and isnt that the point of selling food|0

avoid all they care about is your money they dont care about its customer they have a central line where you call you will get a random representative and they will give you the turn around because you didnt talk to them the last time always excuses and each and every one of them have a different answer each time too like they dont have a management who will supervise them and if you talk to another rep about it they are like oh i cant comment on the previous call like wif but i cant talk to the previous representative either so you are in a lose lose situation avoid this hoa if you can they have no knowledge of their own rules and blah blah blah oh and their website havent been working for couple months and yet its your fault for not being able to get on to your hoa website to see violations dues whatever|0
ya dont be fooled into their handy snap finance program it was presented to me as an option that the balance would be paid off in less than 6 months i would have no interest on my account if i paid it off within 100 days they do not tell you that if you dont pay it off within the 100 days you will be locked into a term of nearly 100 more of your fee you financed for a year in my circumstance i will pay over 70000 for a 58300 balance i contacted them with my frustration they could truly not care and dont have any desire to provide factual information to people stating the truth about their deal they have with snap finance what a horrible business practice that they lie to the community about acting like they are helping when in fact you are being fleeced for over 100 of the balance you are financing disgusting|0

i had retained representation from another law firm after wasting over a year i called a friend who referred me to him i called and spoke to ciara and she set an appointment with is foley one of the attorneys at the practice so first impressions are everything you only get one chance i quickly called after the rave reviews my friend gave me ciara answered the phone and asked a few important questions and had is foley return my call after she had a chance to review the case that was pending with the counselor that was taking my case because he was hungry my case is an employment case and he was a pi attorney good thing i called because the attorney had just called and let me know he couldnt properly represent me and my case was out of his wheelhouse is foley called as promised and we discussed my case after our conversation is foley thought my case was a good one and the paperwork to switch representation was made i dealt with the other lawyer for over a year and i dont think i took one step forward and i had to do most of the work that he or his assistant should have been doing him has only had my case for almost 2 months every time i send an email it is answered immediately not a few hours or the same day immediately after not being able to reach my previous counselor for weeks at a time i am so relieved to have him representing me to all the people at him you are definitely doing something right im so happy with the people i have spoken with and helped me i have to give the biggest shout out for being so professional and if she didnt have the answer she found it thanks so much ciara and also to is foley i feel like i am in good hands moving forward and i would recommend this law firm to anyone looking to resolve your legal issues thanks again|1

i like to support the small local businesses but i would recommend against this one they had set up our security system upon the building of our home and so we maintained them for monitoring although the monitoring has very little maintenance im always very skeptical with the monitoring rarely do we receive calls when our alarm is tripped we have mentioned this to them on each occasion with no resolution to the issue howard the manager is to say the least inconsiderate rude dishonest demeaning and not knowledgable we just could not trust him and had several bad encounters with him displaying the above the system that they have is from the 1990s may be even the 1980s and need to be updated to at least a just century security sytem we were so disappointed that we had to cancel our contract and pay a fee of which they have e you for either 5 or 10 years check the fine print on a good note jeff tec hic ian is excellent trustworthy and very responsible and should consider joining a more reputable company|0

custom body i out our called me in mid february to inform me that my voucher that i purchased online on 1211 is now going to be serviced through them because the other provider was not able to service all of the customers that purchased the deal through the online provider they did not have the equipment or resources well that explains why after leaving messages for two months and complaining to the online seller that someone was finally calling me unfortunately this company is 37 miles one way minutes one way drive away from my house where the other company the one that i thought was the company that i purchased deal from was only 7 minutes away from where i live custom body contouring informed me they have a different system process than the original company of where i purchased deal from in which it cost me an additional 255 for the 3 treatments in order for their system process to work see results and takes longer in their office i had to take a half day off from work since this ordeal in drive time and procedural time took over 4 hours after one treatment no results success i went ahead and booked appointments 2 3 to finish my voucher and prepaid the extra agreement contract for the ads ons that i was convinced i needed in order to see results i was called while i was on my way to appointment 2 informing me that their machine was down broken and that they would call me back when it got fixed in the next day or so i had not heard back from them until a week later and at that time i was admitted into the hospital having various tests being run i informed them that i would have to cancel appointment 2 which would have been my last appointment if their machine had not been down the week before because i did not know when i would be out of the hospital after receiving my lab results from the hospital it was advised for me not to follow through with the remaining two appointments in addition to me being on a driving restriction too risky for me to be driving that far with the episodes that i have been encountering with my health being in and out of the er 7 times this month i called custom body contour 4 times informing them of this requesting a refund of my unused portion due to medical reasons restrictions and offered to provide them lab results if they were in doubt with no immediate response or returned phone call a week and a half later i receive a call indicating that their explanation was dropped in the mail for my request and was not discussed in details of what their explanation entailed they just wanted me to know that they received my calls and were responding since i left several messages my experience with the staff was that both service providers were very nice and knowledgeable the day i had my first treatment even though i did not see any major results i was willing to do treatments 2 and 3 to use up my vouchers add on package my experience of not having someone pick up the phone or return calls within a timely manner 24 hours was unfavorable especially since it had to do with a refund due to health reasons and not setting up an appointment for new business revenue i was refunded 100 which was nice on their part but enclosing my add on contract showing no refunds exceptions keeping 70 of their add ons services not provided in addition to the unpaid portion of my deal for services not rendered 99 is a lot of money for a single income to lose due to health issues beyond my control and medical bills forthcoming they did not even offer to extend voucher when i get better if the first company would have called me in a timely manner in december when i purchased the voucher i would have already used the voucher before these health issues came up and i wouldnt have requested a refund and had an additional 255 in my bank account i just googled the other companys website and it automatically goes to custom body contours address etc but under the other companys name interesting word to the wise do not prepay for a package if you are going to try this treatment do it one treatment at a time if you are using your voucher from the other place try a treatment without the add ons first and then purchase the add ons per treatment if you want to see if it really does make a difference|0

my first visit to any tesla facility whatsoever not surprised that it is located in an upscale urban mall where i am told is the place to do retail in the greater toronto area they had a couple of models regular sedan and an upcoming suv the place was busy with so many folks getting educated on all about electric vehicles they dont sell the cars here but allow you to sit inside get a feel for the tesla approach ask questions etc there is also a bare chassis so you can see the internals of the car and it appears to be a clean engineering design a cute touch was a little tesla on display for the tiny tots future customers i imagine if you wanted to learn more i would recommend this place instead of browsing a web site|1

i went here twice once about 5 months ago and the other time a week ago both times were dine ins the wait staff is cordial and the decor is decent for a pizzeria they have a very nice terrace with a fountain and a decent sized parking lot both times we came pretty late in the evening and there wasnt much of a crowd only 12 other tables we ordered a medium pepperoni bacon pizza thats what my date enjoys and it was delicious i do admit that when i got to my last slice the crust started to sag and the oil was to be desired but it was still very yummy once it arrives its crust is crisp on the outside and soft on the inside they actually use bacon slices and not bacon bits which i applaud them for that must be part of the reason why it is so oily after a while and so yummy id go back here if i was in the area hopefully earlier in the day so i can enjoy their terrace|1

my wife and i were in the neighborhood with my brother because we were going to show him around lakeview cemetery we were looking for a place for lunch and it being memorial day this was the only place open it didnt look too busy but we were told it would take a few minutes to seat us the hostess gave us our menus and pointed us to our table and we sat ourselves then we waited for about 20 minutes before someone came by to take our drink order so we ordered our food at the same time we were never given any water or any bread even though other tables had some and we were getting antsy so we started to play the game where you pay attention to who was seated before you and when their orders were taken and who gets their food before you and we are losing this game i think we were coming in last place in this game several tables are already getting food though they are mostly getting appetizers and were still waiting and around the forty minute mark when we are still just sitting around with our iced teas and waters and no bread we start talking about how we should just leave 5 on the table for the iced teas and just split our food finally comes after we were there for nearly an hour the 10 caesar salads my wife and brother got we nothing more than lettuce peppering farm bread crumbs dressing and cheese and not enough for a stand alone meal even for lunch we kind of assumed they would be because they were only 2 less than some of the entrees and because they also offered a 7 version my brothers wedding soup never came we mentioned this to our waitress but she didnt really bother to notice she was very inattentive and it wasnt because of the amount of tables she was waiting because she was often just farting around near the bar we quickly ate and didnt want to wait around for another 20 minutes to get our check so we just threw enough money on the table to cover our bill and walked out|0
here is the advice that the certification council for professional dog trainers gives regarding choosing a trainer next meet with the professional are they professional in their appearance and in their marketing materials can they knowledgeable and clearly answer questions regarding animal training animal behavior and their training methods do you feel comfortable with them personally are they patient and thorough in answering your questions do they have experience in working with the issues that you are experiencing with your animal can they provide references from clients it was uncanny how my robinson acted completely contradictory to how a good qualified trainer would act in nearly every single example randy still will not qualify what he considers to be very good results that vague statement is as thoroughly as he was ever willing to answer any of my questions coupled with a lack of references my robinson wasnt able to demonstrate to me that he was comfortable or qualified to help my dogs behavior problems|0
let me start off by saying i have been a member when it was tac u for over 20 years in fact i remember opening my first checking account here when i was in high school back then the customer service was top notch and the tellers were so friendly which was one of the reasons i was so loyal to the credit union i moved out of state years ago but i kept a small savings account open as i do visit from time to time the statements have continued to come to my moms house all these years long story short my account was evidently deemed inactive two years ago and they have been charging me a 5 month inactive fee for the past two years additionally i am being charged a 5 month fee for receiving a paper statement what i had no idea as i dont ever see the statements and i couldnt believe they were essentially depleting my savings 120 year at a time once i realized this was happening i spoke with the supervisor michelle who rudely told me these fees were in the fine print when i opened my account and that she would not be reversing any of them she actually recommended that i close my account which i was more than happy to do i realize the banking industry is trying to find creative ways to boost earnings but nickel and di ming small accounts with outrageous fees is not the way to do it|0

i recently purchased a engagement ring here at first i thought that the service people were great they gave me the fake to propose and then we would come back when the real was ready but once i decided on the ring the welcoming nice sales people just turned i guess they figured on to the next one i was walking out after paying she looked at me and just turned away after the ring was ready we go to pick up the ring waited 15 mins to get some ones attention then the cashier says ok so your remaining balance is with my fiance standing right beside me no apology just a little smirk i will not be recommending spence to anyone they treat their customers terribly|0

planned this for a friends birthday wrong call the boat is totally run down there were cobwebs on the windows stacks on chairs on the top floor where we were and a constant stench of unclean carpeting water and drinks service and desserts were in plastic cups and plates food was not good eggs were burnt the salad ran out by the time we got to the head of the line and took 20 mins to refill the servers were in a foul mood all of the time one of them gave 6 cubes of potatoes i counted to a friend when she asked if she can have some more was given a i crowd when my turn came i was asked to take it myself when booking i wrote down allergies to green peppers and strawberries for us we were one of the last few people taking food however after we had out plates full with whatever we were dished out the manager it seemed said there was a special plate prepared for the allergies we asked a how come she didnt say anything until after our plates were full i were there any peppers used in the food that we would need to be aware of no and decided to not waste food and proceed to eat back on the top section of the boat we asked if we could have a pitcher of water at our table no you have to come up to the bar every time to refill your glass but saw carafe at the table in the lower floor that is because they dont have a bar there so we let them have water at the table what the final straw one of my friends spoke to the manager about the horrible service she never apologized once my friend was not rude just politely explained what we had experienced then as we were trying to enjoy the scenic view possibly the only part we did she comes over wagging a piece of paper with our booking information and the allergy list saying we made special food for you that you never ate that you didnt tell us about until we had already made a plate and that no one got strawberries with their fruit as you were allergic what was she seriously blaming me for not giving strawberries to the other guests also please note when we mentioned the poor service and burnt food we never asked for a compensation of any kind just to give feedback on our experience no wonder there are always discount tickets for this disaster of a cruise online no one in their right mind would pay full price for it|0

their chicken wings are pretty much cardboard laced with sugar glaze honey garlic or tobacco hot they had a special this week for 045 per wing and we thought why not big big mistake chicken is dry like cardboard a lot of the drumstick pieces are practically just bone the chicken was probably sitting there the entire day it also has the old meat kind of smell yuck|0
i am almost 16 weeks pregnant and was experiencing severe migraines and couldnt keep fluids down for about 48 hours usually when your e pregnant and go to urgent care the physicians and nurses treat you like like an idiot who just cant handle pregnancy the staff here was super polite friendly and answered all of my questions the doctor was amazing and really helpful he even answered some of my questions that did not necessarily pertain to the reason i was visiting they can do ivs and fluids at this location so it saved me a very expensive trip to the er if you need to go to urgent care go to this location|1
if there is only way i could give him 0 star i would definitely give him that i would never recommend him to anybody i am still his patient right now but i really cant take this anymore i am not really happy on their service with me most especially the scheduling an appointment plus theyre too slow on processing my braces my last visit was november and the next appointment they can give me is february thats way too far it is just so ridiculous that they would give me the reason that the doctor is only available every friday what about the patients that is not available on friday like me because i also work that is really unfair that he doesnt prioritize his patients i am paying in time but thats the service he will give me i guess he only wants my money he know that i am paying and thats why he doesnt care anymore who would be happy with that of course none they should inform the patients ahead of time on whats going on ive had experienced that they will have to cancel my appointment in the last minute take note im already outside the door and thats the only time their scheduler will inform me that nobodys inside and the doctor is not there how ridiculous that is i am so pissed off and upset i hope they can do something about it well in my own opinion and advice for anyone who is planning to get him find and look for a different one|0

i have had 2 mom to be facials at 889 yoga and all i can say is that they are nothing short of incredible they use all organic natural products so i didnt have to worry about any toxicity or chemicals and the whole experience is simply amazing the head hand and foot massage that accompanies the facial just leaves you so relaxed i live in ny and have traveled back to toronto and included this in my itinerary twice during my pregnancy it is the best facial i have found in addition pauline followed up with me and sent me links to products that were safe to use during pregnancy which was so helpful i wish i lived closer so i could go more often|1

we rented haul i from mail plus twice the first time last summer was a very positive experience the 2 brothers working the store were helpful accommodating and friendly we rented a truck and 2 furniture dollies last week the girl who checked us out took us around the truck for inspection but never had us confirm reliable items in the truck were sealed properly we did not use the dolly that was in the truck when we returned it an older gentleman charged us for the dolly because apparently the seal on the tie had been broken it was only a 4 charge but we shouldnt have been charged for something we didnt use especially after paying for 2 heavy duty dolly rentals when we tried to state our case he abruptly cut us off in conversation stated never mind you wouldnt understand insulting me then grudgingly told us he would credit the dolly charge and walked out the back of the store with nothing else to say it was very rude very abrupt and he didnt want to listen to a word we had to say we thought it was over after he agreed to the refund when i logged into my credit card account not only was i not refunded i was charged twice i had to file a dispute with my credit card company i am very disappointed this is the most convenient store for me to rent a truck at and i like the european food market however due to the way i was treated i will never return|0

beware of the unrealistic model that they show you it is very pretty however the lived in units are older and poorly taken care of they also lack in communication and customer service do not waste your time here as there are other places that will make you much happier this rental is unacceptable for the cost i had a very horrible experience i these folks and would want to save anyone the tears headache and stress that i endured i this place there was a breach of confidentiality my credit card was sent to a tenant instead of corporate and they also forgot to notify me that utilities needed to be set up days in advance leading me to arrive cross country to have no ac and no hot water thus having to stay in a hotel for 3 days just dont do it i moved out after 5 days thats how bad it was|0

disaster wishing i could give 3 negative stars had asked for a bid for 2 panes that had the plastic panes slipping first bid was high and i had so windows and glass give me another what was missing in their end bid was a job half done now i only have one window with drooping pane just nuts if you are crazy enough to deal with these people get everything in detail and in writing as they are super smoke and mirrors show with this aspect when i told them that both windows had the bronze panes and mentioning i wanted them fixed i received a bid but seemingly only for one pane now it looks horrible as only one was fixed and paid more than 60 of the previous bid what a rip ray charles and stevie wonder could have ascertained what was needed and what i wanted but now it looks junk my advice is shop around and if you feel the need to support this business get detailed estimate on exactly what is happening better yet choose another company with better dealings and customer service i give so windows glass huge fail|0
staff just seem burnt out the customer service is really lacking they really have no concern in their customer loyalty or keeping customers coming back the facility is sometimes clean and sometimes not the water last week looked disgusting it looked thick i cant describe it any other way the play area toys are grimy more often than not but i decided to write a review after this experience they were using our instructor during our 30 minute private lesson to train new staff he spent most of the time talking to this new staff about how to instruct when we said something to the staff after about 10 minutes 13 of this lesson was already wasted then it took a few minutes to sort it out now wed wasted 15 minutes of a 30 minute lesson this was the first lesson since we have been back where my son was back to being comfortable and attentive in the water and it was wasted on training their own staff he was off jumping around on the platform and playing he basically got a 10 minute lesson because they usually play with water toys the last min as a reward for listening the playing is fine but i am not okay with spending 42 on a 10 minute lesson i would also have preferred that they informed me of the training in advance as i would have known there would be wasted time and then would have rescheduled my lesson sneaky sneaky bad customer service the worst part when the staff started scrambling around after we informed them about the lack of attention during our private lesson we asked that he stop training during our lesson the person i am assuming is a manager or owner came out of the office and once she heard what was going on she hid in the back offices and did not say anything to us i mean a manager should have at least apologized on behalf of the business and the right thing to would have been to reschedule us for a new lesson nope nothing our instructor is good adam which is why we return and we have now signed up for a bunch of lessons coming up so we will see that through we are looking for a new school after that|0
i came here around a month ago for a balmy age caramel highlight i ended up with an ombre ash blonde highlights the service was excellent and the salon was clean however the most important part to a hair service for me is the end result of my hair it doesnt look bad its just not what i wanted i mentioned i was going on a one month vacation after and couldnt get it fixed the following days thinking they i be more careful with the colour i will most likely not return|0

this page was hard to find because stay america is written as one word when it should be two regardless hopefully others find this review despite the poor spelling of the name i stayed here during cancer treatments i rented a room for 10 days got a rate of 40 per night for part of the stay and 50 per night for the rest i was happy with the rate the good my room was clean bathroom clean bed linen clean counters dishes fridge microwave all clean but there were some things that this place ski maps on for starters the bed is horribly uncomfortable its very old and very stiff so old in fact the oxspring is falling apart literally the pillows smelled funny i ended up buying my own new pillows and putting theirs on the top of the closet along with the bedspread i never use the spread in hotels the to was a small 15 or 19 old fashioned piece of junk and the cable had something to be desired they only offer 15 channels 4 of which are espn and 4 of which are news the rest are pretty much junk except the local channels and showtime the phone in the room was very old and dingy i didnt even want to touch it it was so yellowed i got a nonsmoking room but could smell the smoke from the other rooms in my room at night there is no closet with a door the closet is an open space with 4 hangers in it visible to the entire room the pics on their website shows more cabinets lower and drawers than there really are silverware u tinsel i are scarce you get 2 spoons 2 forks 1 butter knife 1 steak knife that doesnt peel a potato 1 plastic slotted spoon and 1 spatula you get 1 pot and 1 fry pan 1 dish cloth and 1 dish towel no paper towels you get 2 large plates 2 small ones 2 bowls 2 coffee cups 2 plastic drinking cups you get two ice cube trays in the freezer but the water tastes funny so i bought ice i feel for the price they should have a few more niceties may be more silverware a few more cups more linens|0
ive been to a lot of hakka places like feed ricks lin garden hakka work etc and this place stands out due to the food and value the pak or as here are excellent they are crispy not oily at all and full of flavour portion size is also huge chili chicken is also good compared to other hakka places i usually get take out and it seems like the choice for most people as this place is normally pretty empty in terms of dine in customers you also get 10 off on orders over 30 if you pay cash|1
this place is a joke they had five tables of people but it took them over an hour to get my table our food when we asked why they said it was because they were busy it looked like the entire place was being run by two people i predict they wont be in business six months from now|0
the worst customer service i have ever encountered i am self employed and if my customer service were this poor i would have no business their paper rates are very high and there is no flexibility in anything my husband and i are leaving for an extended vacation and they would not accommodate us in any way not by giving us credit not buy extending the subscription by 12 days the number of days we are out nothing the only thing we can do is pick up twelve papers after we come back that is absurd do customers really want to read 12 papers that are not current news pig obviously does not care any more about satisfying their customers what a shame|0
hands down best doctor in vegas any person having a problem with him must be crazy such a warm welcoming doctor who is insanely knowledgeable about everything he has saved my life before and i am forever thankful for that|1
wow im not even sure what to say i try not to be negative so ill post a couple pros along with the cons pros the store is big enough that they have a fairly wide selection of merchandise it is worth going throughout the week to shop for items with the color tag that is 50 off and on saturdays when those items will be 1 cons the price is are out of their minds i am from la and was just in visiting for a short time and our area goodwill i have the same or better brands for half the price of the items at this store who in their right mind is going to pay 20 for a used ann taylor loft blazer at a thrift store it felt a little dirty cluttered in there but may have been because it was a busy saturday when i went in i would pop in again just for a quick stop to glance through and see what is on sale but thats about it|0
not a big fan of this place at all they never seem to have all of their cupcakes in stock when i go as well the icing is sickeningly sweet it tastes like pure sugar and not in a good way the last cupcakes i got were dry and the red velvet tasted no better than your average grocery store red velvet cupcake mix wouldnt recommend|0
my experience was absolutely great great service as well as the people that work there i love the atmosphere and the whole setup of the office|1

i dont live in cleveland anymore but i did grow up there every time i go home i make it a point to get at least one meal from a is grill the menu is mostly sandwiches but theyve also got fries waffle cut and sweet potato and some other sides the sweet potato fries are some of the best ive had as for the sandwiches they can come hot or cold i prefer hot they put a crazy amount of toppings on there including banana peppers mayo and oil those toppings all come standard so you have to specify what you do not want otherwise you will end up with a humongous mess some items to consider buffalo chicken sub is very good the cheeseburger sub yes cheeseburger sub is also worth trying they have a solid italian sandwich as well all in all a is makes some of the best sandwiches on the west side of cleveland it should definitely be getting more love on yelp|1
our insurance co refered us to this company after a water heater leak ruined our flooring though they were quick to do the initial estimate we have had nothing but trouble ever since broken appointments non returned phone calls numerous start dates set but no workmen ever showed up it has now been 6 months and they still have not started the job yesterday was another day of waiting for no show workmen it is the last day we will wait for them we have hired another contractor if you want an estimate that lets you collect from your insurance company this is the group for you though they did forget to list the black mold which will need to be treated if you want the work actually done i suggest you look elsewhere|0

the staff is super friendly the good is prepared fresh and tastes so good my current favorites are the warm chicken salad with lemon olive oil dressing i love all their soups very flavorful the mushroom soup is just amazing but i wish they served a bun with it my only con is the price they are quite expensive compared to other restaurants in the mall but i feel sometimes you have to splurge on good food ill be back bonus discounts available for mall employees|1
super clean and friendly animal hospital i took my two kitties there for their vaccines and a nail trim i was most impressed even upon the initial phone call the rep was soo nice warm and gave a very comprehensive explanation of their services and prices she readily offered me a tour of the facility which i accepted before bringing my fur babies again everyone was super friendly and pleasant the facility clean and they even offer you bottled water and coffee i completed my paperwork when i finished my tour so when i brought the cats for their appointment i didnt need to complete it i was a few minutes early but they took me to an exam room right away my only minor complaint which is what knocked down a star was that the tech seemed pretty inexperienced and nervous he had a hard time getting basic vital signs almost forgot to take ones temperature and had a tough time with the other one the doctor was great she asked lots of questions and made good suggestions which i appreciated they also have a boarding facility which is reasonably priced with a lovely area just for cats the location is great the customer service fantastic and my babies were treated well so i shall return|1

as you know or dont i love libraries i grew up as a young child volunteering at my local towns library and even during primary school middle school oh gone are my days of shelving books ahah sigh since moving to cleveland in august 2017 ive been to many libraries my first time to this library was yesterday the rocky river public library is definitely on top of my list of favourite public libraries upon walking in yesterday afternoon i was greeted by a front desk staff who explained to me the layout of the library upon asking she also explained that i dont have to be a rocky river oh resident to join the library to join the library you have to show a drivers license with your current cleveland address on it or a bill that has your address simple the library has 3 floors if you count the basement as a floor the basement has meeting rooms and a restroom with a drinking fountain the est floor has the circulation desk and as you enter the library there is a whole wall that has informational flyers on it and a board that showcases library events and the and floor has tables and chairs for working a quiet room section called the such lather room a room for periodicals magazines adult fiction and nonfiction and a childrens section up above floor 25 the quiet room has all the adult books so im not sure how quiet it will be in there since people will come in and out to look for books but when i was there yesterday 30 april 2018 it was fairly quiet there is a whole other side section on the and floor right below the childrens section that i didnt get to explore but i peeked through i forgot what is over there but i guess youll have to go to the library to find out also on the and floor are sofas to sit on which is awesome upon arriving and chatting briefly with the front desk clerk i immediately found the quiet study room and got to work the quiet room has 6 tables with 2 chairs in each table and plug sockets to connect your laptop i pad tablet or phone i love the fact that library guests can bring their own water bottle or drink into the library because i know some libraries do not allow this it helps bringing my own water bottle so that i dont have to go to the water fountain every time if i need a drink of water speaking of water fountains in addition to the one in the basement there is one on the and floor by the bathrooms as i left i had a nice conversation with a different lady at the front desk i will definitely be back this summer to join the library and start borrowing books this is my with yelp review overall with review for 2018 aiming for 60 reviews in 2018|1
i havent had the korean or japanese food yet at table top grill and sushi but thats not why i went there table top grill and sushi is one of only now two or three restaurants that i know of in the phoenix metro area that serve je amp pong and tang say uk i think they said they do ul yeon and related dishes also these dishes are all examples of korean chinese cuisine so the wikipedia entry id give them five stars because they do the je amp pong and tang say uk and its a reasonable drive from my office but i need my wife to sample their fare before they are so designated regardless i recommend this restaurant because i enjoyed what they served me|1
ive been waiting a while to write this review because i wanted to be as objective as possible we had our wedding reception in july 2014 at boa dens we had the tudor room which is the smallest of the 3 rooms with such a small wedding guest list we opted with the smallest room minimum guarantee 120 people boa dens is an ideal reception hall if your e looking for a hall that has everything included im talking everything fancy table covers napkins flowers full sit down dinner a do open bar our guests loved that and the wedding cake there is also a lovely bride room to freshen up that is lockable so you can lock away presents the office associate linda was fantastic she was patient very helpful and has evening office hours for those who work during the day we were able to walk around the hall multiple times we got to sample the dinner we chose including dessert the prices are very reasonable especially if you book off season they have monthly specials and cheaper prices if you book a fri or sun there are extra fees if you want to use the projector or have a candy table for example and you have to pay for a guaranteed amount of people regardless if they all show up overall we had a fantastic celebration at boa dens and i highly recomend them to any engaged couples i know there were a few blips along the way but that happens to the best of us my only real disappointment is that they spelt my name wrong on the welcome sign on the red carpet i give this place 455 stars|1
i visited the store today and was pleasantly surprised by its size cleanliness and variety of products and services the store is bigger than it looks from the outside i was immediately greeted by friendly staff and was offered help with everything i needed the staff seemed genuine and knowledgable offering a lot of help and tips i found really great products because of their help and guidance so what do they have basically everything the big name pet stores have and more at a much lower price they have a huge selection of pet food including high quality brands that are hard to find at outsmart petco they had a variety of treats toys grooming supplies training supplies cages and beds in the back of the store they had a full service grooming area overall i think this store will do really well because its local convenient reasonably priced and carries a wide variety of products i will do all my puppy shopping here from now on|1
im a young guy and im brand new to wine ive done a few tastings but i really dont have a developed palette so when i walked in to the naked grape i was expecting to feel out of place and may be a little bit embarrassed about my lack of wine experience boy was i wrong we sat at the bar and started looking over the wine menu its a pretty extensive list at the time of this review they had over 75 wines which change seasonally within minutes the owner had approached us and was politely chatting us up he asked us a little about ourselves and we told him how little we knew about wine he seemed very happy to answer all of our questions and to help us choose the right wine he made us feel completely comfortable there he made a point of speaking to almost every customer to see how things were going to me this is absolutely crucial and the fact that he took the time to speak to a young scruffy looking know nothing like me tells me that he really must care about his business to top it off he and his wife seem to hold the philosophy that people shouldnt be afraid of wine this is evidenced by the menu which makes wine and food pairing a cinch by giving good suggestions they also do some of us a favor by including an americanized name under each of the always hard to pronounce italian dishes in their food section the price was right i think i paid 7 for my glass of wine which is about average for their menu and seems on par with other establishments ive visited but you can almost certainly go higher or lower i would strongly suggest bringing several friends and splitting a few bottles this way you get a variety of tastes without breaking the bank it was a really great experience unlike anything you can find in the area if your e interested in wine be it beginner or wine connoisseur i would highly recommend the naked grape|1
all i ate today and here i am on the bowl suffering from explosive dia hi a i felt like the chicken tasted odd and having never eaten undercooked poultry before that may have been it that being said the staff was very nice and the place was comfortable but ive been feeling sick ever since i ate there and thats all it takes for 1 star health first guys sorry|0
a real butcher shop stopped by today for the first time and picked up some beer brats hot dogs and bone in rib eye steaks we cooked the dogs and brats for dinners the kids ate the hot dogs super fast the brats were amazing usually we marinate the brats before we cook these went straight on the grill and the flavors were great everyone raved about how good they were i am very excited for the steaks tomorrow anyone looking for good quality meat skip the low quality grocery store and make the stop they have a great selection plus they have a camera directly over their cutting board so you can watch as they hand cut all your meat cant wait to go back for more|1

i have had a completely unprofessional and poor experience with this business one month ago i had started a prepaid service at this business i went in to pay the bill they accept only cash or debit card the person behind the desk has to key in the payment to another place done on his personal cell he repeated the number and was 1 digit off from the number that i was attempting to pay and have credited i said no it is xbox he told me not to correct him he had been doing this for 10 years i apologized and said i just wanted to be sure the correct account received credit he told me i had an attitude and could take my business elsewhere i had opened this account for a secondary phone and had been waited on by tom who was very helpful professional obviously service like this makes it doubtful that they will remain in business|0

excited to try this new place we stopped in for lunch on our way from barump to costco in las vegas my wife had a bacon and cheese sandwich and i had a chicken breast with garnishment both on grain bread the sandwiches come with a fresh side salad which was good the chi teas had way too much ice and not enough tea the service and ambience of the place are good including the old ford fu stake bed truck backed up to the patio and the historical pictures displayed around this is a great place for mountain bikers bikers and tourists to stop in for some food and refreshments|1
this is the place to shop from the moment i walked in all the way through to check out my experience was incredible i could have stayed in there for hours the florals were off the charts incredible and so original the staff was knowledgeable and helpful but left you alone to shop and enjoy the beautiful items they had everything from candles jewelry art accessories antiques furnishings and gorgeous high end pillows were everywhere i cant wait to go back|1

hands down the best chicken natsu in las vegas the natsu sauce is really what makes it even better their portions here are big so it is well worth your money that you pay for it since i moved here from hawaii 7 yrs ago i was always craving plate lunches like at all and was glad to find one here but i was really disappointed with the food there it was overpriced and greasy ill write a review on that one later we stumbled upon this place when i was working at smoothie king across the street my parents were waiting for me to get off work and ate there of course getting me a natsu plate to go i was a regular there quite frequently some of my other favorites was the mahi mahi plate loco mock teriyaki chicken burger natsu curry chicken natsu plate with curry on top and teri chicken plate they served poke here once in a while and the chantilly cocoa puffs too its sad to say that they have closed down on december 24 2010 but they said if things get better they may open up again it was a good run while it lasted now where the heck am i supposed to get bomb natsu|1

if zero stars was an option i would choose it in a heartbeat the good planned parenthood is low cost and very helpful for women and men who want to take care of their sexual health katherine is a wonderful doctor who really explains a lot about your options she is kind attentive and interested in your well being the bad the reason why i would give zero stars the customer service at the front desk is abominable they know theyre horrible and openly admit that theyre never on time every time i go in i get the sob story about their computers and yada yada yada theyve been having computer problems for over two years its not just that one time its at least a two to three hour wait each time this particular visit and my last the lady at the front desk said it doesnt matter whether or not i make an appointment theyre always behind and ill only get seen when they catch up i dont pay to come here to hang out all day and listen to their computer woes never never go here i would gladly join in the protesters outside if only they were protesting the horrible customer service this place offers|0

ill start off saying hugo was always professional and understanding throughout the whole deal i just gave up i held off writing this review because i was giving them the benefit of the doubt but at this point i have found enough wrong that i feel like i was robbed i was referred by family they did a great job on my father in laws house i was not so lucky they were supposed to start painting on monday and finish wednesday it rained and was windy so they didnt get started until wednesday and the whole job was rushed and done terrible i was charged extra for them to scrape and prime the eves of the house this was my primary concern for having the house painted they never got scrapped and i had to ask multiple times to have the nails from the previous owners christmas lights removed they only did the first story the eves on the second story are peeling already and look terrible there is overstay everywhere all over my patio and front door i had to clean it off the handle even on my cars i had to remind them to paint the stucco wall which i was charged extra for they had to come back 4 times and i just got tired of being a pain so i gave up the final straw is when it rained and my front door paint faded from the water after further looking i have found large sections that were not painted they left a pile of trash in my backyard the size of a car which my dogs got into they did terrible work and charged the normal price per square foot as any other painter so just find another company there are plenty out there they did knock 100 off my 2900 bill for my troubles yay|0
i used to like coming in this store when trevor was here but since the remodeling and change of staff its more like walking into a funeral home so depressing and dull no music just deafening silence the 2 guys who work here now mike and some other idiot dont know anything about i apes theyre just really stupid and act like theyve just woken up from a nap no energy or excitement plus they are very very overpriced their juice is not great the samples you get to taste are so drab and unappealing that it doesnt do much for me i only go here because of its location but even thats got me thinking ill go to blue dragon just because of the atmosphere and selection and prices red star you really need to get your act together and make peoples experience a positive one when they visit your store very disappointed|0
beautiful location with warm decor service was slow and inattentive ordered appetizers bruschetta was french bread pizza not good calamari was just ok caprese salad was decent stuffed mushrooms were all grease would not recommend based on apps and service|0
this place is a gem it recently went through a refresh and the place is bright and super clean staff are very friendly and have excellent attention to detail walked out with the best pedicure ive had in ages they use a lovely scrub provide great leg and foot massage and use a hot towel before polish application great colour selection and polish brands op and beyond they also offer shellac and bio gel although i have not had these services so cant provide feedback also offers waxing and threading of which the staff are always gentle and thorough will make this place my new go to as ive been to others in the area and the experience and end results have always fallen short for me please keep up the great service and attention to detail six tips|1

food and service was great prices super affordable everything on the menu rocks definitely going back|1
the ingredients were very tasty i love the fact that they have shredded brussels sprouts kale and lobster that really separates this place from other poke spots the one issue i had is the shape of the bowl its just too round and high you cant mix your bowl properly without stuff falling out id suggest getting the flat and more boxed containers so we can mix our food easier|1
this place is terrible stay away my uncle was sent here after an extended stay at mayo hospital the staff at life care did not follow the specific doctors orders that were given to the life care staff he had a followup at the hospital and transport was arranged by life care during his visit with his doctor he was he told me his chest was hurting i checked his oxygen tank that life care also provided for transport and it was empty he was then readmitted to mayo yes he does have some serious health issues but skilled care is not what he received the great people at mayo saved the day by getting him a full oxygen tank|0
the food is good but beware of the conniving ways they use to get more money out your visit first when the bill is brought to you there will be a service charge of 15 added to your check after tax even if there is only one or two in your party this is not disclosed on the menu or anywhere else in the establishment and if you pay by credit card the customer copy nor the merchant copy will reflect that they have included this service fee second i knew of this little scheme when i visited there so i was prepared and gave the additional tip as cash but lo and behold when i received my credit card statement they had added an additional amount to my bill after i left i called to question and was told that if the tip is not adequate they add more what when i told him i left the tip on the table he said he didnt know that but now you know how we do things i have filed a complaint with the bob i hope this review will make others more attentive to their bill and credit card statements|0
very nice and welcoming staff their lattes are really good always a treat although i havent had their pastries the muffins look super delicious i also love coming here because its in the same shopping plaza as my dentist so its super convenient|1

i bought an online coupon for highlights and a cut at divinity hair i had decided ahead of time that i wasnt going to get my hair cut because ive had horrendous luck at countless supposedly high end salons for many years no one listened to me and gave me the hair cut complimentary to my curly hair nicole gave me lowlights they looked great and told me she would still honour the haircut if i wanted to come back at a later date a month or so later i decided to bite the bullet and let nicole cut my hair i am so glad i did she gave me exactly what ive been trying to get for years she has a customer for life i highly recommend nicole and her prices are very reasonable bonus|1
stayed here for 2 nights with a group was in a 2 queen sized bedroom with a full kitchen and bathroom air quality if you want vegas throat stay here ugh i could not fall asleep because my nose kept getting stuffed and my throat was killing me from the air recycled air from the air conditioner system was the worst i thought it was just me getting sick until i found out that the other guys in my room plus the group from the room across the hall felt the exact same way cleanliness the room and bathroom wasnt dirty but it didnt look the cleanest free wifi yes free wifi but it cuts in and out all the time very slow vicinity nearby is a starbucks supermarket baja fresh and other stores its convenient i stayed out of the room as much as possible if you can deal with the vegas throat you could stay here but ive had a much better sleep at a motel 6 in vegas|0

this place is super cute and opens really late in case you feel like walking around and shopping its located near tao in the venetian the items look delicious they smell even better the scents are strong so be ready for that i got some colorful donuts and although the sales associate gave them to me in a pastry bag she wrapped them because i mentioned it was a present this place is a bit pricey so not for everyday soap use but if your e feeling fancy be my guest|1
this place is crammed with people and really really bad drivers as well i just witnessed a hit and run in the parking lot this past saturday afternoon and that woman just dashed away so quickly after seeing that i am very afraid of parking there anymore and if you are the owner of that poor odyssey you might be able to get some info from the surveillance cameras around the walmart best buy or outsmart area|0
the owner was charging my credit card even though my daughter was no longer taking dance classes when i asked for my money back she would only give me one month she probably didnt even notice my daughter wasnt in class anymore because if she did she could have called and said hi mars so and so your daughter hasnt been in class for 3 months let us know if shes withdrawing so we dont keep charging your ca lol well that didnt happen she just kept charging my card and who knows how long she would have kept charging my card had i not noticed i guess she wanted to see how long she could milk me for its a tacky place anyways the bathrooms are always dirty and out of to the teachers are always calling in sick they even forgot to some of the girls names on the program for the recital we paid 80 for save your money and go elsewhere|0

i found the decor and ambience to be quite pleasant the virtual art across behind the car streaming snippets of old french films the presentation of the food was original and artistic we had the tour de france cheese platter oysters mussels drinks were average i have had way better old fashioned i for a whiskey lover although the bubbly was great by the glass this place was overpriced but i am glad i checked it out|0
i am the owner of a network consulting and design company several 2011 tax policy changes as well as an admittedly mismanaged tax structure led to severe irs tax debt tax crisis institute ti managed to not only resolve all of our tax issues in a timely manner but were able to succinctly educate us on what we needed to do in the future to avoid tax issues and use existing tax policies to save money hence the 5 star rating ti was the first business we attempted to contact after researching several companies based on our needs on a personal note i am very happy about choosing them first as i do believe our issues were simple but we would not have received the amount of service that was given by ti we contacted the company and spoke with angelique she was very pleasant and after our issue was explained she explained the tax relief procedure and went through a thorough list of our options depending on what we wanted to do we spoke in great detail about what would be best for our needs and then after agreeing to use their services we set an appointment the office was very accessible with a friendly environment angelique was also the representative who spoke with us in person she showed great care in her work and a masters level of comprehension in all tax related fields the amount of professionalism knowledge and empathy shown was impressive and appreciated after several post meeting correspondences we noticed this was a family business and this reassured us as to the reason we were experiencing so much extra care than would be normally be experienced in more corporate structures overall because of the timely manner in which our issues were resolved as well as some vital advice given and extra care taken in our case this potentially disastrous experience was actually pleasant in addition to my anecdotes it seems they are accustomed to dealing with high profile business level clients i would rate this business an excellent complete 5|1

went in to seriously buy a car with my dad and my sister was approached by in der who took my dad inside and all the salesmen crowded around the desk because they pick from a list who the salesman assisting would be well we got a moron because he took as on a wild goose chase around the parking lot while he clicked the electronic key to find a car later to discover that car had been sold already i then he started panicking and trying to sell us any old car pointing to ones that werent even in our budget or taste the last try was when he was like look i found you a perfect car but there was a sign on the dashboard that read sold by in der that we had to point out to him lol they really need to hire better people to take care of their customers because we got a real sucky car sale men|0

check out reviews and bob rating of 1 before you go here i loved the sofa love seat recliners i purchased and i even went as for as to buy the extended warranty with them because of it having the recliners the sales person said this is a must it will cover everything for 5 years even if we cut the leather well with in 6 months the handle broke on the one recliner first they are never there during the hours noted on the machine at customer service the store will not assist in anyway except when they took my number to set up the repair and never got a call back when i finally got through to customer service i was then told this would not be covered this is a wear and tear item which i laugh when the couch is not even a year old so i will need to pay for the handle and then pay them 4500 to come out when i took their extended warranty if you want a company that will stand by their product this is not the one when i told the customer service rep i would like to complain about their practices she told me i would need to call back their is not a manager in on wednesday i would need to call tomorrow that goes to show they have no one of any quality running this company|0

a library in the ghetto actually its more of an internet cafe minus the cafe since there are several tables with computers and only about 6 book shelves then again the internet has largely replaced the need for libraries to store large quantities of books after all why keep thousands of books on hand only to collect dust when there is seemingly an infinite amount of material to read online but i digress anyway this place isnt too bad i suppose but theres one employee in particular who is just a total grouch she gripes if you walk up to her instead of using the automatic checkout computer but half the time the computer gives you an error message so you have no choice but to visit her when you tell her this she gets even more huffy so you just cant win|0
my gynecologist is do a deg oke i was not too sure about having a male doctor at first but from the day i met him he exceeded my expectations by a long shot he saw me through my pregnancy first baby and was very polite and understanding with my questions and concerns he delivered my son michael at um and although i as very scared he was quick and efficient with my i section and assured me id be fine which i was lol the staff here is extremely sweet and attentive they remember me and my son each time we go theyre all very friendly and patient with me thank you all do beach to i is my sons pediatrician and all i can say is she is the sweetest thing i met her because my baby was sick and his pediatrician was unavailable and from the second she walked in the room she was a ray of sunshine very friendly and caring she showed interest in my concerns immediately and tended to them she even gave me call the next day to see how my baby was doing my baby couldnt habe a better pediatrician and i couldnt have asked for a better gynecologist|1

fair and expense go hand in hand so the over priced everything didnt surprise me is it worth it honestly not unless you get an unlimited ride band youll spend more on the other days since you go through tickets fast i checked online before attending to make sure my oldest daughter could go on rides she could but many of the rides marked as ok with an adult werent when we got there that was a minor annoyance the rides were short despite the fact there were literally no lines it was opening day on a friday and no lines i mean thats fantastic but also a sign that something may not be right staff was generally fantastic but 30 seconds at best on a 6 ride was excessive now lets talk about the fight i was in the area minutes before it happened and staff ended up telling us to stay put inside the coliseum during it as it happened directly outside i appreciate them keeping us safe and informed but not a great experience as a matter of fact a few of the people getting arrested on the news ran through the building directly in front of us another reviewer said to leave before night and i wish i had that advice beforehand its absolutely not a safe place which explains the heavy police presence all day to top it all off getting out after this fiasco was a literal nightmare would i come here again absolutely not there are plenty of other overpriced fairs in the state minus the late night thugs|0
the good my parcel was packaged very securely and well thats the only thing that got them the 2 stars the bad when my parcel went missing even though it was marked by ups as delivered when i was home all day the only way i recovered it was through multiple calls to ups customer service they first told me that it was mistakenly delivered to a different address on my street an address that does not even exist then somehow found it and completed delivery three days after having marked it as delivered this ups stores response five days later they emailed to essentially say sorry not our problem meanwhile i had initially incorrectly contacted a different ups store i the area the one at 4885 midnight road to report the same problem within 5 minutes i had an email response directly from the manager who then called me personally to discuss the problem suffice it to say i will be using that store on midnight road 0434 for all future shipping needs as an aside i used to work as a up in the ups corporate office in atlanta and the midnight road store managers response is what we would have looked for in an exemplary store|0

wow i am visiting from boston and have traveled to a bunch of ymca but this is by far the most impressive facility they have a womens only fitness center in the womens locker room for petes sake the machines in there have seen better days but the gym on the third floor is top notch they have a piano the staff is friendly and everyone seems to be smiling im only not giving the facility 5 stars because their visitors policy is ex per month which is very limiting for me as a member of another ymca and as someone who travels for work their membership dues are based on household income which is an interesting model that clearly allows them to expand membership opportunities for lower income households and provide the community with an amazing gym love that|1

while im sure at one time george was rational and reliable when it came to fixing jukeboxes in my experience that was not the case at all in fact i have never in my life had such a horrible experience with any company ever i called george because my jukebox a family heirloom was not making any sound he came to the house and said it would be 1000 since he would need to take the sound board back to his shop to fix it we gave him 250 with the agreement that we would pay the remainder when he brought the board back in a few weeks 8 months later i call him to see what is taking so long and he doesnt remember me has no idea who i am seriously i decide hes senile and cut my losses then a few months later he calls and says he finally remembers and is coming with the board gets here and the soundboard isnt the same one ours was in perfect condition and this one is all scratched up but we still let him do his thing whatever the box finally plays one song so give him the remaining 750 and he says its gonna be an additional 1000 what i refuse he leaves and i go to play another song jukebox doesnt work now the records get stuck whenever you try to play them which never happened before i would have called and demanded he come fix this but honestly he was so rude from the beginning and obviously not all there i truthfully didnt want him back in my house now he calls every few months to demand we pay him the money we apparently owe him for work he did not do threatening to put a lien on our house even though there was no contract and we never signed anything no receipts nothing we have lawyers in the family we know theres no way he can take us to court over some money for a job he did not do the man is completely unhinged i will just have a nonworking jukebox forever if it means ever dealing with this company again|0
i am a fan of this shop it carries a beautiful collection that i have yet to see in pittsburgh but im also writing this review because i was completely turned off by the unfriendly and pretentious air of the employees my friend walked in the store said hello and just got stared at i didnt try to say hi the owners or employees need to realize that the shadyside of the is is over attitude does not give credibility being good at what you do and acting like you enjoy it will do the trick|1

this store has set hideous customer service standards i was lied to about their return policy by an employee and screwed over they gave me the run around when i asked to speak to a manager she was conveniently never present and was the only one who could help me when giving me the final verdict on my issue she cowardly had her employees do it for her on the phone of course not face to face and could not even call me herself i highly recommend taking your business to a different pet boutique where quality service matters|0
sleep country canada slogan is why buy a mattress anywhere else but i think it should say you should buy a mattress somewhere else terrible customer service i have never felt so bad shopping before for anything i went inside the store with intention of buying a mattress i left vowing never to shop at sleep country canada ever the salesman i description is bald middle age wears glasses and is either south east asian or middle eastern he was the most aggressive and rude person i have ever met from the moment we went in he was pushing for a sale he didnt ask to give us for a comfort test or anything i dont know why he was following us around if he was going to keep badgering us to buy after trying 3 beds in 10 minutes he said if your not going to buy then i have more important things to do this isnt fun and games this is serious business at this moment i said dont worry we wont buy from you funny thing is the store was empty i came away with few questions answered and disgruntled ill be shopping at their competitors stereotyping your customers as not serious buyers and pressuring them for a sale in 10 minutes when they havent made an informed decision is the worst service possible i could not buy from this company knowing that my bed was profiting a slimy and sketchy salesman this is a bad brand avoid at all cost i would have given a negative score but of course that isnt possible went to ikea and spent a lot on a mattress instead|0

i have been going to this location for several years although after my last experience i wont return there has always been an air of pish posh snobbery here at eye mart express and why i cant begin to imagine the staff never says hello when you enter perhaps theyre overworked or just having an off day either way that is just not acceptable furthermore i agree with the previous reviewer about the nickle and dime culture they seem to have going on here they will seriously do anything for a buck do funk hauser herself has always been quite nice but im afraid she must direct her staff to squeeze every penny out of patients why else would they act this way there is clearly a deeper public relations issue going on here and it is also clear that this location must address how they are being perceived or many once loyal customers may do like i did and go elsewhere|0
amazing im not a fan of bars but i absolutely love rosemont i went on a saturday night around up with 2 of my friends it took us 30 minutes to be seated which was understandable since they were packed the food was great i order medium wings and i loved them my friends ordered sweet potato fries a side salad and macaroni and cheese they absolutely loved their food as well the staff was very nice there were very sweet ladies that walked to each table to collect plates when the waitress was busy our waitress morgan was so sweet helpful and knowledgeable the drinks were simply amazing i ordered the peach drink that comes in a pouch similar to a capri sun and i loved it i ordered a total of three that night lol parking was a little difficult but the bar is located in south end the food and drinks are amazing and theyre usually busy so i wasnt surprised nor did i mind waiting ill definitely be returning to rosemont on a regular basis for those complaining about the wait time you cant blame the bar for having great food and a comfortable environment no one wants to leave|1

my family starting with my bab cia when i was a child has shopped at brandt meats for many years i was very disappointed in the incredibly poor customer service from anna who basically said too bad to my seven year old son when we asked to use the toilet in the back of the store the toilet at the front had two men working in it who told us to use the toilet in the back what kind of human being tells a little boy that he can go pee himself i guess that i will have to try starsky holler da or some other store like it very disappointed|0
last night we found a pretty good sized leak from one of our bathroom vents big water bubbles and constant dripping so this morning i called troy and they had hunter at our house in the early afternoon on the same day i had called probably about 6 different companies to get some different bids thinking it could be a big project ended up cancelling them all after hunter left from the moment we spoke to troy my wife i and i knew this was an honest and hard working company very understanding knowledgeable trustworthy and professional hunter called with an extremely professional and polite heads up that he would be arriving in 2025 minutes and was right on time i cant say enough about the kind of person hunter is a hard working honest and very knowledgeable person he took the time to assess the issue explain it to us and what the proper fixes would be hunter even went above and beyond and helped fix things that caught his eye in our attic i must note that the attic is way hotter than even the temperature outside nevertheless hunter spent a long time up there fixing issues and taking the time to explain them to us just an all around great human being hard to find honest humble and hard working companies and this is definitely one of those companies hunter also installed a new nest thermostat for us and helped with programming i would 100 time and time again go with this company and specifically hunter and troy i dont write reviews often but thought that they more than deserved this one we felt like we gained a friend through this all thank you again i am 29 years old and my wife is 28|1

update i sent this email to the company on 71413 i am writing because i have to let you know how disappointed i am in the full detail i received on my 2012 honda civic this past saturday 71313 let me start by saying that this is the second time i have gotten my car detailed here i was thrilled the first time my car looked better than the day i pulled it off the dealership lot it shined and looked beautiful for several weeks later this time is a different story the job that was done on my car is amateur at best first off the bumper looks horrible it doesnt look like they put any effort in to remove the bugs or grime the bumper and headlights are still covered with bugs and grime i noticed when i picked the car up and i really regret not saying anything i further regret tipping because it was not warranted on further inspection i am now starting to question wherever or not it was even waxed there were water marks and streaks all over the bumper and car if it was waxed this shouldnt be present i feel like i have to go behind the work that was down and clean the bumper myself also the interior i dont think was fully detailed i dont believe that the doors or dashboard was wiped down at all in fact i know they were not as there was a small dirt mark on the volume button that was still there when i picked the car up the dashboard also still appeared dusty i should have been worried as the first time i brought my car it was there the entire day this time it was in 4 hours i was called at 100 to pick up my car it so upsetting as i know the work that you did in the past and this was the level i expected again i feel like i could have done the job better i think it was washed and vacuumed and that is about it also i had a blanket on the seats that was balled up and some how had gotten wet so i now need to wash that there was also still dirt in the truck to top it all off i had some quarters in the coin holder and they were stolen mind you they left the pennies i am just really upset and very disappointed the first time i got it done i was signing your praises and was recommending your company to everyone i will not be returning a third time and will caution others to have their cars detailed here it is sad as i thought i found a place i could trust to take my car to be detailed on a regular basis|0

roadhouse touts themselves as the only ultra dive bar on the strip and i would have to agree i am the kind of person that tends to gravitate towards the dives rather than the clubs the vibe is just so much more fun and laid back extra bonus points if there is a game playing in the background after doing much research on where to spend new years eve we decided on roadhouse the idea of being on the strip instead of floors above in a hotel and the fact that tickets were only 50 which included an open bar totally sealed the deal for me was it upscale and swanky nope but what dive bar is i mean who can say no to stripper poles cages and tires hanging from the ceiling the girls that work there are hot which means awesome eye candy for the guys and its just an all around fun place to party the only downside is you have to walk into the imperial palace to use the restroom i did learn a shortcut though instead of walking to the back of the casino once you walk in the doors take a left hop into the elevator to the ith floor and walk instant relief plus there is a bar there just in case you cant wait to get back inside roadhouse the manager grant was helpful and cute and the bouncers were cool all in all we had an awesome time here on new years added bonus was the fact that all we had to do was literally walk out the front door to see all the fireworks at midnight rock on roadhouse is because they were expecting a large crowd that night they had to remove all of the beer pong tables but i thought it was a worthy mention who doesnt love a game of beer pong on the strip while in vegas|1

after a positive first experience my second visit to midtown honda left a bit to be desired i received an email promotion advertising a free multipoint inspection 12 months of free road side assistance it seemed like a good deal and knowing i needed a front brake job anyway i booked an appointment within 2 hours of dropping my truck off not a terribly unreasonable wait still a little long in my honest opinion i got a call back informing me that in addition to front brakes my filters were due to be changed and my power steering fluid needed to be replaced i had a meeting in the afternoon and couldnt be without my vehicle so the dealership arranged a complimentary rental car very quickly i might add and i was on my way i returned to the dealership later that evening once the work had been completed after paying and getting my truck back i noticed i hadnt been given any documentation pertaining to the 12 months of free road side assistance i was supposed to receive when i inquired i was told that because my truck was still under warranty i already had road side assistance included although i was happy to learn this i was disappointed that i was not offered something else in lieu considering the offer i had received and the amount of money i had just spend on routine maintenance i also noticed that my oil life indicator had been erroneously reset to 100 yet i had not received an oil change when i inquired about this i was told the technician had made a mistake no real apology was offered and no effort to make it up to me was extended at the very least i would have appreciated a complimentary oil change especially considering i now have to manually track my oil consumption one other small point of frustration was the fact that when i arrived to pick up my truck it was still dirty not that the dealership had offered to clean it or that i had asked them to but a quick rinse off seems like a tiny cost effective value add that would really mean a lot to most customers all in all i still plan on taking my truck to midtown as this wasnt a horrible experience just a bit of a let down after the first visit update hey wayne your response has gone a long way in reaffirming to me that your dealership is committed to a high level of customer service i realize that its easy to make small mistakes especially when doing something routine the reset indicator light wasnt the end of the world just a small annoyance thank you for the explanation and the follow up with the technician im also very pleased to hear about the new car wash i sincerely appreciate your offer of an oil change and filter in lieu of receiving the 12 month road side assistance offer i dont know how difficult this would be for you but it might be worth eliminating customers still under warranty from future emails of that nature having said that i do enjoy your newsletter updates and will still be keeping an eye on any offers that do come through thank you again for your prompt attention to this im looking forward to my next visit cheers jeff|1
the bartender michelle is very rude not only did i tip well but i would gather people to this bar for extra business how this bartender re payed me was by over charging me while i was under the influence she took advantage of me and my friends when i was busy having fun and living up the atmosphere this bartender took advantage of us while under the influence and continuously over charging us when we became aware of what michelle was doing she then made false accusations about us and had us band from the bar we expect people who work in this environment and their proprietor to have our better interest at heart because we the customers but in this case it was not the fact people at the bar and other bios need owners know that shes a crook thats why people refuse to come to this bar i cautiously warm anyone who goes to this bar to watch what they are being charged or theyre accused of the sad part is proprietor wife saw all and all she said is i know you are good customers and i will talk to my husband but as a customer services rep what she should of said is you customer bring my business and you all mean more then one bartender who is ripping you off and making false accusations that with out you girls my husband would be out of business i seriously warn all customers of this place|0

ive been to this nail spa on about 45 different occasions and have never had an exceptional experience a few weeks ago on a friday afternoon i went in for a gel pedicure and it took over 2 hours when i finally had to tell the nail technician that i was out of time and had to go she had already had to remove the gel polish from one toe after she placed the dryer to close and it dented the polish after i got home i realized i had the same problem on the other foot as well it was very obvious and i was disappointed she let me leave like that i called back to the spa as i was driving home and spoke with the owner and expressed my frustration with how long it took for my pedi and that i was now late for plans with friends that evening i was then there again this last sat 1025 and again had an awful experience i had called earlier in the day and scheduled a liquid gel manicure for am when i got there they were not able to tell me the nail technician i would be with it seems they rotate through them so your e not able to schedule with a specific person i was finally seated for my appointment around 1130am 30 minutes after my scheduled appointment the nail tech then took an hour and 12 for what should take no more then an hour she would ask me how my nails looked and i had to advise her of the flaws lumps bumps and waves that were still visible on my nails after she fixed them twice i was too frustrated to keep providing her feedback and i was out of time i had a wedding that evening that i needed to get home to get ready for as i was leaving i asked to speak with the owner i had spoken with him after the hour pedi experience and i advised him i had been there multiple times and i was again not happy with my experience or satisfied with the results i told him i did not expect to have to pay my bill of 45 he told me he had to speak with the nail tech first because she works on commission huh hes the owner and should have made the decision to take care of my bill and handle her commission or not based on my experience if your e looking for just a basic manic edi this might be the place for you but this is not the place for me and i will never go back too much time and too much money wasted already|0

i just got married recently i am really disappointed with their service and rudeness they scammed my wife into getting their vip grand luxury coach and she decided to go with it so we wouldnt take any chances on our wedding day and guess what the bus was garbage the washroom stunk like theres no tomorrow the door of the washroom kept opening up every time and smacked one of the groomsmen worst of all the buss speaker kept blowing up every time we tried putting the volume up we didnt even get to 60 of the total volume bar now all this is still okay by me but when my wife calls she gets disrespected by somebody called ross and i can hear him shout on the phone telling her that we didnt have somebody to back up the bus funny thing is all the groomsmen including myself work in construction and we back up trucks almost everyday we backed him up and i tipped him a 100 as the driver had nothing to do with this crappy company after that i realized he went around my father in law and asked for a tip again boy thats not a tip anymore thats a salary absolute garbage and i wouldnt recommend them to anybody not even my worst enemies i spent is of thousands on this wedding and i had almost 1520 vendors and these guys are the only ones that dropped the ball i hate this company and i hope they dont make a dime after this i would say go to hell too but even hell is too much for you|0
only open for 3 weeks december 07 and already its a hit with the local crowd i tried an iced mocha drink that was the best ive ever had my iced drinks from starbucks caribou and arabica tend to have a chalky finish this was delectable to the very last sip good coffee excellent location and a great reason to avoid the chains the logo is adorable but im giving it only four stars for cheap ing out on the menu boards and other signage its all part of the experience|1
i purchased a group on for mo cette which gave us a value of 80 which would then just be deducted from our final bill which actually turned out to be a great deal i usually use a group on when trying out new places i was look on forward to eating at mo cette because of the great menu options my reservation was for up however we around a bit early at 530 since there was no one there we got seated very quickly our waiter was fantastic very polite and very personable the chef on the other hand was a definitely story for whatever reason he insisted on making it a point to tell us that he would not start cooking until up which i wish he hadnt done because it just made things awkward and i really didnt find the food to be delayed at all so it was a completely unnecessary comment to make thankfully the food made up for his attitude i ordered escargot and rigatoni and my boyfriend had salad and half a cornish hen the food tasted fantastic it was seasoned nicely and all cooked very well i honestly dont have a single complaint for dessert we had creme be le which was also pretty perfect overall the experience was enjoyable and i would probably come back again with another group on|1

i went here during my lunch hour one friday afternoon i had heard good things about the company from friends who have shopped here before im sort of mildly obsessed with wearing formal attire to work so i am anxious to find a new go to shop in the city as i just moved here from out of state i work a corporate job so i was hoping to find a place in town to shop for clothing items when i walked in i was immediately greeted by an associate at the door he was a heavy set fellow wearing a suit that was obviously much older than me im 22 and a tie that was absolutely not complimentary to the suit he had on he looked noticeably shocked that someone of my age would shop at such a store he quickly profiled me from head to toe and i could definitely tell that judgement was immediately made i asked if i could look at the selection as i am in the market for a new vested pinstripe suit in an attempt to strike up casual conversation i mentioned to the associate that i am very much into dressing well for work and that i was looking to expand my collection he remarked he was confused as to why someone like me would want that and how wearing a vested suit is just not in style anymore i brushed off the commentary because i just dont really care about his opinions or anyones for that matter anyone who had an ounce of respect for a customer would never be have like that anyway so i kept looking the remarkable thing was how this gentleman just wouldnt leave me alone as i was looking at the suits of course i was respectful to all of the merchandise in the store i wasnt looking to try anything on i didnt even take suits off of racks shelves i was just interested in looking at what they had to offer i wanted to see if i should come back and consider a purchase in the future but no matter where i went throughout the store this man would not leave me alone he kept following me and kept looking over my shoulder he even asked me at one point to not touch any of the suits because he was afraid of damage i had not actually touched anything and i had no plans on touching anything his body language throughout the whole time was also incredibly abrasive folded arms unwilling to make general conversation and just overall incredibly condescending attitude towards me when i asked if he could recommend any decent tailors in the city he mentioned that he didnt think he had any for me obviously a lie there were several business cards for tailors on the counter he made it very clear i was not welcomed here unfortunate because they seemed to have a decent collection of suits the only reason why this review is 2 stars and not just 1 i met with another pittsburgh based clothing shop over the weekend the associates there treated me with respect kindness and professionalism heinz healy i lost a potential loyal customer to this other shop|0

at first glance this place is confusing is this a bar from the guys who created the restaurant that anchored the modern roncesvalles community like drake cafe is this an art is in al pre marinated butcher shop competing with custody i and rowe farms nope in fact barque butcher bar is an innovative biq community a one stop shop for improving your grilling game while drinking at least that is the intent it seems accessible to almost any level biq skill though i am the kind of reviewer who finds pure joy in the charcoal and wood room at ontario gas barbecue heres how it works at least for me 1 get a drink and talk biq make a plan choose a meat and a time frame in my case i sipped on a tasty korean sake and chose a brined chicken to indirect grill with fingerling potatoes the same evening much of meat is brined not pre marinated though i had no idea about that with the lack of signage 2 decide on a premade rub or better yet grab another drink and with guidance from the dave or one of the other staff make your own rub rub creation happens at the bar and spice rack across from the butcher area again there has been a real signage problem here i spoke with several people who have been to bob and no one had noticed the rub making area for me this was the completely awesome part i have been making recipe guided rubs for a long time but dave explained his concept of how to structure a rub starting with a salt sugar base instead of my usual time consuming process of looking through a richen book and hunting down spices in oversize containers you can just get it done all of the spices are available in small containers for 1 and there are many that most of us do not have in the kitchen a good example is klepto which i am now addicted to on popcorn all in i left bob with dinner for 3 and my drink for under 30 its true that the signage is confusing or nonexistent i would bet that vast majority of customers dont know that you can make your own rub bob is innovation in progress but like ontario gas biq a place that can toronto on the global grilling map but of course the in store experience is just the first part according to my partner who is not easy to please in this department the chicken roasted on top of the potatoes in our big green egg was better that barque i chicken im sure the innovators behind bob would be delighted to hear that|1
its a chain so you probably know what to expect with the food delicious if you are unfamiliar with panda they offer great chinese food at the ready at good prices definitely grab chow me in and orange chicken then throw in any of the other entre i kung pow being my go to also the spring rolls are great and be sure to experiment with sauces this particular one however lacks in service theres usually a long line that is poorly attended upon often times ive had to wait while they cook up refills ive also seen them have only one person on for dishing out food and running the cash register besides the service being slow the place is clean and has good seating perfect place to grab a quick meal or to cure that chinese hankering good lunch for with friends or solo study time|0

not sure if this is the same location because my receipt shows this cafe name with only one i in siena regardless this is located inside the seacoast casino beautiful west side of town with views of the strip great place to go to during the middle of the week which we did less crowded and better service i went with the tuna melt which was very good as far as tuna melts go my wife went with something called crispy tofu these are deep fried sticks of tofu though i would have preferred a thinner batter they werent bad if they had a way of grilling the tofu i would have ordered it myself well my wife didnt finish them but they did make good leftovers overall good service and food but do yourself a favor if smoking bothers you which it does us ask to sit in the back of the restaurant as it is close to the casino|1

why you need to come here fresh takes on southern fare beautifully plated and delicious food in a refined setting affordable prices connected to the posh dunghill hotel the asbury is an elegant yet not stuffy place for brunch lunch or dinner this past weekend my husband and i stopped by for brunch and loved our entire experience the food the service and the setting the dishes that we sampled reminded me of charleston i exciting dining scene charleston i famed chefs take southern cuisine to new heights and so does the asbury i talented chef just like they say on their website the asbury i food and presentation is southern and modern i got shrimp and grits dont expect super creamy grits and shrimp in some thick sauce or sauteed in heavy spices no sir the grits were formed into rectangular cakes which made them look like fried pieces of tofu the shrimp served alongside the grit cakes was actually a light shrimp salad all this served on a bed of really fresh really vibrant lettuce this dish was absolutely wonderful i would highly recommend this menu item unless you have a shellfish allergy or dont like grits this lightened up rendition of a southern favorite is reason alone to come here tom is chicken in a biscuit served with a medium egg wasnt bad either it was also beautiful scrumptious and very flavorful our server was really nice and not pushy at all all i got was a mimosa but she didnt treat us any differently after realizing that we werent lush es she even kindly took our picture so we could remember our awesome dining experience at the asbury definitely stop by the asbury if your e visiting the charlotte metro area|1
the indian guy that owns the place stands at the counter and gives his staff evil looks if the put too much in the sandwiches bit of a joke honestly i ordered a foot long and it only had 4 slices of meat had to complain to the parent company as it was basically a bread sandwich for 8 bucks theyre not even meeting subways minimum content standards as the owner is so busy policing his margins if subway were a half decent co they i revoke this guys franchise save ur money and go to the burrito place next door ex the food and much better quality for less money|0

we prepaid for a cleaning with this company and had almost given up on redeeming our voucher we could not get in touch with anyone from this company when you call it says their mailbox is full i called the coupon company where we bought the voucher for a refund and then surprise surprise i finally got a call from them our cleaning was finally scheduled and we were promised they would be there on the saturday between 121pm we waited all day for them to show up and no one came not a call or email nothing i can tell you i was not very happy to have stayed home on a saturday all day waiting for these guys to come after complaining to the coupon company yet again surprise surprise i get a call from them again saying they were really sorry and promised to be there that following wednesday i had to work that day but my fiancee was able to work from home so he took care of answering the door etc a single girl shows up with no cleaning supplies i was never told that she would not have any cleaning supplies what kind of cleaning company just sends some one over with nothing to work with we dont even own a vacuum cleaner as we always get someone in to do it we only have a couple of area rugs when i got home later and looked around hardly anything had been cleaned the floors upstairs hadnt been swept the bathroom was completely untouched the glass in the shower hadnt even been wiped mirrors toilet sink nothing etc she had basically done a bit of dusting in the living room downstairs wiped the dining table and had cleaned the top of the stove and the ultimate horror i had discovered she had dumped about 100 food pellets into my fish tank i spent the whole evening trying to clean and vacuum out the food i had to put the little guy in a hospital tank as his pooing was out of control fish will keep eating whatever you feed them and i only usually give him one pellet per day it took the poor fish about a week to recover and i am still trying to get the water quality back in balance weeks later this service should not be in business if they offered me a free cleaning i would not take it i would not trust them with a ten foot pole ive sent ann numerous emails to no avail i havent even received an apology please avoid them at all costs on a side note i dont know where they get the testimonials on their website the images beside the comments definitely look like stock photos something fishy going on there|0

i have been going to this office for a year and a half now and the last four appointments i have gone to have been horrible experiences with the nurses and office in general regarding trying to get my script faxed over or dealing with insurance four separate times i have had horrible encounters with these two nurses they were rude disrespectful and aggressive with my 1 year old daughter when it came to them having to give her a shot or take her temperature i called twice to make a complaint about the nurses and nothing was done and nothing changed because i went back for another appointment and had the same poor experience i was there this morning and one of the nurses that i made a complaint about and asked to not have her be around me and my daughter was there to take us back in the room weigh her take her temperature and of course she had a poor attitude and was very disrespectful im very sad about my experiences with this office because i love the doctors and my fianc even went to do dorm e when he was a child so its sad for me to have to remove my daughter from this office and find another place to go i really hope that they improve on this so that no one else has to go through what me and my family have had to go through|0
while the colour ist and owner diana did nice work you need to know that the pricing is ridiculous 55000 for a colour and cut there were no problems with the hair prior to the colouring so no need for corrections or anything there is just no reason to be gouging people like this i have been to other beautiful and reputable salons that were truly high end experiences and paid 30000 my fault for not getting a quote when i spoke to the customer service specialist she broke down the fees they charged and said if people dont ask how much the service is we believe they dont care how much we charge well most people care and dont expected to be taken advantage of in such a severe way the service took 3 hours and not even one request to get a client a water or coffee etc low budge attitude with manhattan prices|0

i had heard good things about pin bar so i decided to grab dinner and play a few games last night the staff were very friendly and attentive even when it got busy it is a nice sized space you dont feel crowded in at all they have a good selection of machines pinball and video game as well however the food probably surprised me the most i think i had low expectations because i assumed the focus would be on the gaming aspect of the bar first off i appreciate that their lower priced items like the homemade pizza pop still had a high attention to detail using a nice flaky pastry to elevate the classic snack the poutine was also really nice some people might not like that the gravy and cheese are one entity but i thought it prevented the pork belly from being too much my friend had the champions of breakfast and also really enjoyed it im looking forward to trying some of their cocktails next time i will be back|1
terrible expire nce i had to run a few errands in the area so i placed my order online and it gave me a pick up time at 625 i walked in about ten minutes after that the girl asked my name made my payment and then told me my order would be out soon i sat down and noticed how filthy the floor and counter were about 20 minutes of waiting she brings me my pizza problem is i had ordered boneless wings as well which somehow they forgot to make again another 15 minutes goes by and i finally get them i get home to open the pizza box to notice it was partially burnt and 2 slices had no cheese just the toppings on them i was very disappointed and will no longer give them my business|0
pros super easy to park purchase a day pass get your equipment put your stuff in a locker get on the lift ski down and repeat food bar had a decent number of selections and was priced well and tasted good if you are a beginner this is a very easy place to ski or learn how to ski the hill is not very steep or difficult to get down we went on a thursday and there were not very many people there there were no waits for the lift and it was easy to get to them from the lodge cons for the most past the snow is not real it is manmade and because of this it can get pretty icy and sometimes hard to maneuver skiing on fresh powder is ten times better because this is a local resort it is not very big it takes 5 minutes to get down the mountain and there are only a handful of slopes so youll ski down all of them fairly quickly there is not much variety|1

hostessing internationals calgary incarnation is a wooden building on the eastern edge of downtown calgary it has many of the usual amenities of hi hostels a games room computers to use and free wireless internet a to room and a fully equipped kitchen my experience there wasnt great though the dorm rooms have 6 beds in them which makes for a very cramped atmosphere even by hostel standards it was also one of the most uncomfortable beds i have slept in plus i was kept awake by people being noisy in the common room across the corridor and the lack of action by the hi staff you never expect luxury at a hostel but i was particularly disappointed by this one|0

the staff is very welcoming at first but once they get you they dont care when i moved in no one knew that i was moving in nothing was prepared then at move out they require 60 days notice which is a little ridiculous because most people have no idea where they are going to live 60 days from the end of their lease i submitted my notice with 45 days remaining on my lease but they auto extended me to 60 days and charged an extra 800 per month rate on top i think that amount is crap because when you sign the lease it does not state the penalty is for giving 60 day notice and then surprise even in ny where real estate is ruthless they understand that no one knows where you are going to live in 60 days and they are willing to work with you the car gates are broken on a regular basis the people gates are obnoxiously loud ive found nails and thumb tacks in the dog play areas and when i brought it up to the staff they did nothing mid lease my fees went up due to a change in management i am not a fan and i would not recommend this place to anyone|0
these guys and his crew were fantastic these guys was through patient and incredibly responsive to my questions even over the weekend the yard and dog pen came out beautifully and on budget desert springs clearly cares deeply about their customers and will go above and beyond to make us happy|1
terrible experience i figured since this place has good reviews i decides to get my hair done at this place turns out when i had my hair dyed no colour showed up and i wasnt satisfied left to pay 110 christine the colour ist told me she could not get my hair in any shade lighter but i have dyed my hair before and it went to a lighter colour this is the biggest rip off and wish i had my money back|0

i am a big user of yelp but have never been compelled to write a review until i visited this store for the first time today while the employee who greeted us at the door was friendly and helpful the employee near the back of the store was extremely rude and not helpful what so ever i asked her a question and it almost seemed as if i was bothering her then i am walking around the store holding what seems to be 20 items and she never asks if she can help or start a fitting room even as i stood there with my daughter waiting for a fitting room there was no offer to assist with all the items just that she could only bring 5 items in with her dropping items on the floor to pick 5 she just stood and waited looking annoyed it was taking us so long since we had been in there so long we could only try on about half the items and had to leave for an app i asked if she could hold the other half and we would be back in less than 2 hours to try on the rest answer umm no we cant hold items i told her we would be back in less than 2 his she said we can hold 1 or 2 but you have too many so what is it you cant hold items or you can only hold 1 or 2 finally annoyed with how rude and unhelpful this employee was i finally just left and let her know she lost a lot of business i will never go back to that store|0

went for an oil change so nothing too complex they honored the coupon from midas website the checkup they do is pretty good found out that we will need to replace the rear tires soon also we let them know that the steering wheel shakes on the highway the front desk person ram suggested balancing the tires and that should fix it 12 per tire so we were happy that the 24 fixed the problem they didnt try to sell us anything we didnt need so it was much appreciated|1
formally anime ramen i now like it better as world noodle this place doesnt need gimmicks bossa nova music was playing which was a plus to me the prices are very reasonable too most plates are 650 which is cheaper than going to panda express tried the pad thai and the yaki soba noodles and they were delicious the waitress was friendly and always checked on us too i will be back to try some more items|1

i stayed at treasure island hotel with a casino conveniently located inside the hotel along with a plethora of other amenities like spa services dining options shopping etc this was my first time going to vegas and i enjoyed the hotel and all it had offer i also liked that treasure island was located off the vegas strip so it was easy to get around by foot bus or cab the hotel room itself was pretty nice too and we had a really nice view of the city and the pool area of the hotel i would certainly recommend staying here for anyone whos planning a trip to vegas and looking for an affordable hotel thats in arms reach of everything|1
saw this listed in state magazine as a great breakfast stop biq seems to be their claim to fame but breakfast is serves all day my wife went with the traditional eggs grits bacon while i went for the state magazine recommended french toast indeed our breakfast was very good with nice folksy down home service i think everyone who worked there spoke to me before i left as for biq that will be another trip but a positive sign was the large pile of hickory wood stacked out back|1
he so ive never heard of this place i was browsing through eat and moes showed up on the list of nearby restaurants that delivered what caught my eye was what type of food they prepared eat currently lists burgers american late night chicken and waffles dessert i read chicken and waffles and immediately craved it also delivering and open till 230am although there are were no reviews as of right now i went ahead and ordered 2 one for me and my mother delivery was estimated to be 4560 minutes nothing out of the ordinary the driver took a little under 2 hours to arrive at my door step i did call beforehand why its been over an hour and they said they were busy no problem the driver looked like she was in a rush and she also delivered the food in an uber eats bag is that normal still tipped her 20 two different to go style boxes the typical styrofoam have a nice day box and the other a clear plastic style the food was wrapped in tin foil good way to seal the warmth i opened the food and was thinking wow and not in the good way either the waffle didnt look or taste homemade it was like the frozen kind that you stick in an oven the chicken in my plate were pretty much in the same category the stuff you buy in bags down the frozen foods aisle my mothers chicken on the other hand were chicken strips while mine were like chicken poppers the syrup was okay no complaints and beneath the waffle was butter all melted perhaps the driver got lost on the way to the house or may be they ran out of chicken and had to buy some from the store i dont know either way ive definitely tasted a better chicken and waffles very disappointed nowhere near worth 13 bucks a plate|0
great store clean staff is friendly and the food is fresh 5 stars if they were open later currently close at 6 am each day|1
do not under any circumstances come here 1 they dont speak english that well so they wont understand anything 2 they did a horrible job a the front bangs i asked for were not too thick the lady made it really thick i my front bangs has no texture what so ever she literally just cuts the front part but i wanted her to cut it further out however she just literally cuts the front part leaving the sides to be wayyou too long i the cut was very uneven the bangs were all over the line i use to cut my own hair so i know how to cut front bangs both of the corners need to be straight as you can see the lines are not straight i had some obvious hair strands that were just way too long i she also cut this style too short which is another problem because when i curl it it looks horrible i told her not to cut it short she then said she will cut two inch i told her no i dna want too much cut off then she says she will cut two inches and thats when i got so frustrated and pissed off she cut my hair short the bangs are too short as well they look awkward af e when the line parts were not straight she told me to part it myself i got pissed off because thats her job to know how to cut hair not mines to show her how to part hair correctly i after fixing she still had so much uneven hair strands here and there also she cut my bangs shorter again i to top it off she accidentally poked the flat iron into my eye luckily it wasnt the metal part and i flinched back in time so only the top of the flat iron hit me still she hit me in the eye with the flat iron overall bad experience their english sucks which was to be expected but their skills are horrible too heres some pictures to top it off pissed off|0
after 8 years of being a customer i am inclined to review that the service level has declined over this time the staff has become unfriendly and their customer service skills are not attractive i feel like im a stranger and that any time im there i am an inconvenience to the barber ive watched them ignore people while treating others with priority and talk about clients in front of other clients i am questioning continuing my patronage here not only have they raised their prices but then accept cash only yet provide a declining level of service i hope to continue business here but time will tell|0

so i decided to drive up and dine in at chili normally we order carry out after all i just wanted a fuel stop my god this place has gone down hill i want to collect our next reward and never come back gross dirty and smelly i remember when i had several friends work here and the place was managed like someone cared of course that was back in 2005 and a lot has changed the bartender server in the bar was very impetuous and rude when i stated i only wanted water to start he asked is that all very loudly asked for the water without lemon and of course it came with lemon now my guacamole was not ordered as requested done here good luck perhaps new management is in order as they learn from top down and as i was once taught you get what is expected from your employees|0
so after reading one of the reviews below which i just reposted again for effect i think i know why my special needs daughter was standing there at school waiting for a vey driver to go to her therapy apt for over 25 hours basically until i got off work and drove there to get her i even called vey customer service and begged them to pick her up we are not a no show never have been but in 60 days of service vey has been a no show more than 7 times today being a complete disaster they have also tried to drop her at various locations other than her therapy center so today i called and was told a car and then cab 303 was dispatched five times guess the drivers kept cancelling for a reason really this is what you guys do to special needs teens i promise i took a photo of the empty parking lot where there were no vey cars and no green discount cabs and not difficult to see one teen standing there from the other poster driver since voucher calls go to the vey system first and it will continue expanding its search area until it finds one even if the driver is 20 miles away the drivers then accept the call see that its a small one and then cancel the call which makes the call disappear like it was never there the passengers are never made aware and are left scratching their heads wondering why they arent getting picked up ive seen passengers wait for over an hour because this keeps happening my opinion is if the passenger has to call in a and time the call should be automatically dispatched to the cab fleet and no wonder the dispatchers would not tell me what was going on they just politely told me i dont know what happened i will have a car there in 10 minutes obviously they are used to their cars just driving off calling out shame on this entire company|0
great guys and great cars nick has some of the best prices on hybrids around and he paid the taxes even who does that we looked at several of his prius and had a hard time choosing as he had almost every color all services where up to date and our car is still going strong and sipping gas thanks nick and greg i wont hesitate to refer you to my family and friends|1

i really enjoy going to the manor it shows independent films that i can rarely see in charlotte the staff there is amazingly friendly from the ticket window to the concession stand the auditorium is not truly stadium style and can feel a little stuffy if too crowded all areas of the 2 screen theater is always very clean there are some nice restaurants coffee houses and wine bar close by parking can be a challenge on busy nights but not a real issue if you are seeing a matinee before up|1
let me just start off with saying i love applebee's as a chain restaurant the atmosphere is great the food is delicious and im always pretty pleased about the service the past couple times my fianc and i have been here we are always completely ignored the wait staff always seems to be in bad moods and they always serve hard and cold food one of the times we went there we had asked for the boneless barbecue wings and we got hard as rocks breading and gristle it was disgusting and the wait staff hardly deserved the tip we had left them they take forever to bring out food and half the time they dont ask you how your food is and when they do they are pretty rude about it i hate this applebee's so much and i will never ever come to this one again|0
absolutely horrible they dont even try to make sure what their serving good same as service|0

okay so to be fair all subways are just subways i love subway for fast food options and i will always go there but never again to this location i work near here and i go here for lunch regularly but this very particular day the large man with glasses behind the counter basically tried ot lecture me on why veganism is ridiculous and telling me that meat is delicious ridiculing me for my beliefs and basically making fun of me for it i was literally just waiting for him to tell me the price for my 6 inch sub while hes telling me animals stink but theyre delicious to eat like dont ask why im a vegan and then be rate me for my lifestyle choice i will never return and i suggest no other vegetarians or vegans go here unless you feel like debating and arguing and being belittled by an overweight man who thinks hes above you he also told me other coworker that she had ugly hair and needed to fix it on a separate occasion same fat guy same horrible opinionated outlook on life ready to tell others how theyre wrong the worst|0
i waited 1 hour and 45 minutes for my pizza to be delivered then when i got it it was cold i was so hungry but refused to eat that stuff|0
decent pizzas but i like my pizza to arrive hot rather than luke warm the worst part of the meal was the cheap beers if you want to serve micro brewed beers get some interesting beer old milwaukee pabst and the so called micro brews i can buy at costco are the reason the restaurant is empty on a summer thursday|0
this place is a joke i moved out two months ago and the hoa has yet to return my security deposit the property management has changed several times in the past year that i lived there they can not retain staff as its always changing i would not recommend to live here to anyone they have three elevators and only one ever works when you have a visitor the gatehouse makes it complicated for entry cos has moved out which was a nice feature the management office will tell you they have big plans for a food court to move in which is not factual and their other retail space has been vacant for years they are constantly shutting off the water or repairing hot water line at one point it was a weekly occurrence my floor only had one other person on it which made living very quiet however is a good indicator and sign they can not keep residents|0

i work for door dash the lady inside this building ordered food when i got there the door was locked so i searched around the area a little while thinking it was a different door eventually i called her to ask her where it was and she said dude its not that hard i was very polite and yet she was just a total bitch what am i supposed to do when the door is locked i was at the right location its not like i was lost its her fault for leaving the damn door locked not only that but she also left me a very bad rating this was about my fifth delivery with door dash and she just made me want to never do it again i will have to probably do 100 deliveries to get rid of her ridiculous rating you can take this rating right back bitch|0

felt like this was another typical doctor just trying to get money i wrote a very long review but it was apparently too long so keeping this one shorter wait time was fine they didnt check my insurance until the day before called me at up said i had until up to call or they i cancel my appointment not sure why you cant just hand them your insurance card when you come in but whatever i ended up calling them the next morning the day of my appointment and they hadnt canceled which is a shame because it would have saved me a headache along with a 30 copy that i shouldnt have been charged once i got there i felt like the staff was pretty rude i made an appointment for my annual in order to get my be refilled in order to get be i have always been told i needed my annual done for this and why not your e supposed to have it done once a year when i called to make the appointment i stated i need my be refilled and my annual done so i get in and get told i need a urine sample um what i thought that was really weird ive been going to the obey once a year for 13 years and ive never had to give a urine sample also no one told me this and i was not prepared i did not have to go anyway moving on past that i get undressed and the doctor goes oh she made you get all the way undressed again um what no breast exam also the nurse medical assistant aide whatever she was did not close the blinds i had to run my fingers down them to get them to close and i was already halfway undressed by the time i noticed she probably also explained to me to not get all the way undressed before the doctor came in but her accent was so heavy and she talked too fast so i could barley understand her anyway the doctor pushes up on me tells me im good that im due for my annual in a few weeks so well schedule that and walks out what why would i schedule a separate appointment for my annual instead of having it done now it would have taken an extra 2 minutes to do a pap and breast exam what is this so i was charged a 30 copy when annuals are free for me since i get preventative care for free with my insurance i was so mad at myself for not going with my instinct on asking why i was being charged 30 at the beginning i could have just walked out and went back to the obey i saw last year i figured it was just a mistake and id be able to call my insurance later to sort it out now i know better i was also tempted to just ask if i could get a refund once i was being told i need a urine sample and dealing with the rude staff although im sure they wouldnt have been able to i missed my opportunity at the beginning when they charged me the copy there was a scheduling conflict with the doctor i saw last year plus she moved to a different location so i decided to try a place closer i never would have thought in my 13 years of going to the obey for an annual be this would happen learned my mistake|0
made a blue chip reservation and was openly laughed at and refused a rental when trying to use a foreign visa card complained to the manager and offered to pay cash and to use my travelling com anions visa but he wasnt interested in my business the customer service here is brutal and when the manager was constructively told that his car has an attitude problem he turned a blind eye to it stating that she was the best he had i hope this franchise goes out of business i actually saved 50 by renting with payless who rented to me without issue|0
went to this bar for a night out with friends because it had karaoke i am highly disappointed with the fact that they ended up charging someone elses drinks to our card at the end of the night i have made many attempts to get it handled but get the run around on it i left name and number for a call back and its as if the owner could care less now i get to file through my bank to get money back after waiting a week already we will never go back we will tell everyone about this experience and the problems they have created|0

tried the breakfasts here and other locations too really good and good value as well prices have been creeping up in our other haunts so we were looking for a new place they have a small but varied brunch menu but weve tried most of the items and not been disappointed many items come with fruit but the highlight is the smashed brown potatoes these are baby potatoes smashed and given the french fry treatment other good choices were the breakfast tacos poutine the one that comes with turkey sausage generous servings but not ridiculously huge original menu good value and no lineups|1
having spent thousands of dollars over the years lets be honest it adds up on derma planing various peels and expensive skin care lotions creams cleansers etc i have to say that finding cindy at cosmetic laser solutions scottsdale skin institute was a life saver or rather a face saver to all the ladies out there who are spending money monthly on various services stop and go to cindy for a consultation after one laser treatment my brown free fly spots and discoloration disappeared my skin has honestly never looked better and thankfully because of her im not regularly spending a fortune for mediocre skin i see her every three months even though she says i could come in about every 46 she doesnt push products or treatments shes got a depth of knowledge that is unparalleled plus shes kind and honest because of her treatments i rarely wear foundation or powder now because i have nothing to cover up i know different things work for different people but going to cindy on a recommendation from a friend is the best cosmetic decision i have ever made ive recommended others go to her and their skin has transformed as well youll lose nothing for a consult and youll gain so much if you see her for laser work a 5 star service with a wonderful and knowledgeable person to be sure|1
better quality than than office max target or walmart low prices i was looking for a stapler made out of real metal and not a cheap piece of plastic that will break and go to the landfill in a year unlike office max they had what i was looking for at a decent price school supplies were on sale and good quality so i added those to my basket i asked if there was a place in madison where i could donate or recycle used packing peanuts i hate sending styrofoam to the landfill they werent aware of any but told me to bring them to the store and they would reuse them for something i was surprised and pleased that they wanted to help me and the environment overall a good experience|1

brand new facility and its great to have the black card for all the perks included i love this place i hope it stays clean and well maintained for years to come or at least for the duration of time that i live close by customer service is a little lacking and i dont exactly take i dont know for an answer but what can you do its a gym to work out and go home open 24 hours and there are so many machines and programs to check out very exciting to work off all the food i ate this past holiday season|1

so this may in fact be the worst chipotle in existence let me explain every time i show up craving a burrito bowl theres a huge line to the door each person in line is wondering why theyre there you can tell theyre wondering why they put up with the low quality the terrible service the in different management the unacceptable price of guacamole the attitudes of the guy asking you what you want or more often telling you to hold on the only time ive come here and not had to wait in line this troll still told me i had to wait because they were making an order for a family not in attendance ive checked in to this place a few times and ive been to the chipotle by fashion square a few thousand for some reason that place is bomb and this place sucks at this location you have to stand in line among dine in patrons and witness the slop that your e about to ingest and the looks of disappointment on their faces after each unfulfilling bite if youve already decided to eat at chipotle youve probably had chipotle before if your e like me you go to get a burrito bowl with no rice because your e a slow carb or 4 hour body fanatic you know that you can get what you need not necessarily what you want if you want a delicious authentic mexican meal go across the street to julio i if you want to hate yourself and write a whiny yelp review about it come here|0

the assistant manager marla is a horrible example of customer service we went there to cash a auto nation car check that was drawn on boa account auto nation is one of the largest car dealerships in the nation marla said we needed to wait while they call to verify the check the check was for ok no problem although i dont understand why they couldnt just check their account and see they had more than enough money in the account but no oooo oooo after pulling our chain for 15 minutes she lied and said they couldnt cash the check for 24 hours because the check wasnt in the system yet what tit we called boa 800 and they told us there shouldnt be a problem cashing the check the same day the check was written they advised us that a different branch should be able to help we went to a i cone branch and experienced no problems getting the check cashed boom the only difference was the and branch shawn at baseline and rural wanted 2 forms of id no calls no hassles no waiting that is what customer service looks like this is the second time ive had a problem with marla seriously she is the worst we knew she was lying to us avoid this bank at all costs im sending a letter to the head of boa someone needs to know marla is incompetent|0
shopped around for my super bowl party keg and came across this business from a friend when you call them no one answers or returns your call back they have by far the worst customer hospitality procedures im happy i didnt hold my breath in hoping they would return to me with how i may purchase a keg from them not sure how they only have 1 review other than mine if your e looking for a party rental for a keg dont look here because you might get on 5 years later go to total wine or lees where they will actually take care of you|0
i would not recommend this company to anyone biotech installed a radon mitigation system in my basement prior to it being finished the radon level in my basement now tests higher than it did prior to the installation of the mitigation system air techs website advertises a life time guarantee without an additional purchase but dont be fooled according to biotech this just means that biotech will provide the 12 worth of additional pic pipe to enhance the mitigation capacity of the unit removing and replacing the 15 feet of drywall that will need to be cut out to install this piping will be on you oh and when do they tell you about the limitations on their guarantee in a contract that they come up with a year after the fact that is unsigned and post dated do yourself a favor and avoid at all cost|0

not impressed my family meet some friends from out of town for dinner place pretty empty about 7 am my first margarita was great but that was the only thing that was worth paying for the food was not appealing and tasted worse and was not hot more like room temp you would think with only 3 entree items they would have mastered those items my son ordered loaded fries with no sour cream or onions he got both my daughter ordered chicken wings they were dry and not hot temp everybodys order was messed up in some way my second margarita was a waste not good at all our bill was over 100 for 2 kids 2 adults really wouldnt be a problem if we didnt have to order pizzas at the bowing alley to make up for horrible food our server was friendly but still not worth the we will research prior to picking next time|0

on a normal day for a regular fast fresh id give a 4 star this location however is absolutely baller not only is the food good and you have quite a bit of choice as to how you want to customise your sandwich but this location has the biggest portions ive seen at any fast fresh the super nice lady who works the sandwich bar during rush hour is definitely generous to the customer slabs on a tonne of sauce and puts a good portion of food on there it is just way superior to any other locations i have been to so far three i will be coming back and i will be hoping that the sandwich bar lady will be there every time|1
some of the people working here are really nice and helpful especially the shorter young lady may be part asian with really long hair another lady helped me get a bra and she was nice but not present at all and i really needed more help getting the right size because now i have one that is too wide the lady mentioned in a different review with the short blonde bob haircut is truly a nightmare to work with i had a return that was a gift and therefore i have no receipt it didnt have the full tag but did have the plastic tag thing on it and was clearly never used she went out of her way to make me feel awful and refused to work with me i thought lulu stood by their products and making sure their customers were happy i will certainly never go back to that location simply because of her namaste lol|0
i come here often and cant believe ive never written a review but anyways since this location has been under new management their service has greatly improved staff greet thank you upon arrival exit and are all friendly the restaurant is spacious with a lot of seating for being express its clean and tables are always cleared for the next customer the food is your average greek food at less than average dine in restaurants but more than mall prices also the portion sizes for the price paid is great the portions are huge i like the veggie souvlaki dinner which comes with rice a whole tomato slices in half and grilled with feta on top and a sliced pita i really enjoyed this my boyfriend always gets the chicken souvlaki dinner with rice and salad as sides two souvlaki sticks of chicken are included overall however id say the prices are more on the higher end theres a point in time where i stopped coming here for a couple of months because of a negative experience with a staff member but im glad to see all the new staff are very friendly and welcoming so i will continue to dine here|1

was watching a japan themed movie and my friend and i decided that sushi would be the perfect post movie dinner it was late but when we arrived we were still greeted warmly given a complimentary appetizer and thoroughly enjoyed our meals really well priced for the quality we both got sushi combo sets really simple so no spicy mayo or deep fried whatever that normally mask poor quality fish my friend who lived in be for many years where as i recall the sushi fish is super fresh tasting thought the sushi here was very good lastly im kinda grossed out by salmon sushi lately it tastes fatty and artificial to me so not sure if this place gets a different type or cut of salmon but it is by far the best raw salmon ive had for a long time|1

we took our two kids here from october 2011 to july 2012 it was a terrible experience for our girl in the preschool room anthem and christine were rude and belligerent to the kids our girl can speak quite well and would tell us of them putting her and other kids down a few examples they told our 4 year old that her baby brother ate cleaner and that she eats like a baby they would announce who the last one to get their shoes on was and that they didnt get the toys that quicker kids would get outside i even heard from another parent that christine put down the mother to the child they are reprehensible other odd things were that they had to have their blankets over their heads for naps who knows what the reason is for that did they not want them to see what they were up to beyond this we heard both of these caregivers yelling at kids when we were in the coat room area multiple times the other rooms of this daycare are good margaret in the baby room was great and the people from the toddler room seem good as well however elizabeth is the manager and anthem is her daughter the apple doesnt fall far there i heard elizabeth yelling at kids multiple times when she didnt know someone was there i would recommend other daycare if you are planning any long term care|0

we had the choice to use feds flowers or another flower company for our wedding from the moment we sat with renee we knew we were in good hands she seemed to know exactly what we wanted as it got closer to our wedding we decided to add a few more details in to our wedding renee helped us talk about options and what she thought would look good it was clear she is very knowledgeable about what looks good and for a good price the day of our wedding took our breathes away so many people personally complemented us on the choice of flowers and requested to know who did our arrangements i would use feds flowers again without question|1

i came in not knowing anything about wise pies and was very happy with my experience the staff was incredibly friendly and guided me through the menu options as a first time customer i tried the luciano pizza and it was delicious my only suggestion would be to add more pizza options to choose from on the other hand i think wise pies markets themselves being the place to go for choose your own pizza but i like having a variety of premade choices overall good food|1
this is the second location i have tried in toronto the first one was on the danforth that location was pitiful small and the selection virtually nonexistent this location was at least big however the selection was not as great as the one in kingston not sure if this is because there is only one location in kingston therefore everything goes there and each value village location is representative of the neighborhood it is situated in if that is the case the blood location is not the nicest neighborhood so it makes sense that the selection is also not high end i felt that the pants selection ie dress pants and jeans were better than the tops after 90 min of shopping i walked out of there only with a pair of gap jeans for about 3 since it was during the 50 off sale day i waited about 15 min in line for the change room i wasnt sure why they were not using the number system it was also frustrating since there were 3 young people 2 guys and 1 girl that seemed to be just fooling around and taking pictures it was one guy trying on clothes while the other 2 were just waiting around watching and taking pictures they were there a great deal longer prior to my getting a room and they were still there after i finished trying on my 12 items i would imagine they would have taken up a change room probably for a good hour one other thing i noticed was that many of the items at least 4 i picked up initially thinking i would try it were damaged either a hole or stain etc i would probably not bother going back to this location if i happen to be in toronto again during one of their 50 off sale days|0

1 as a woman i find the gym upstairs to be far too much of a pickup joint i loathe being chatted up by guys i dont know hey great stretches right and i stopped going because of that and its not like a 50 yr old in a baggy shirt and sweats is looking for it i also dont find a lot of programming for me in the early evening i refuse to show up half an hour early to secure a spot in a class who has that kind of extra time to waste 2 also there are even fewer options for my 14 yr old sunday afternoon for instance there is kid basketball 912 and table tennis 16 and while there is free swim thats not good for exercise you need lane swimming for that hes been hassled by members and staff that hes not allowed to use the equipment in the gym really like a 59 athletic guy cant work an exercise bike and he is made to use the family locker rooms which dont accomodate a lot of people where 14 yr old girls can use the womens|0

i cant begging to explain the terrible job that was done on my car but before i get to that 1 i read a review that stated that no one spoke english thats so not true at least half the crew is white and the ones that arent i heard them speak perfect english now for the actual experience the actual people working there are really nice very respectful and courteous the place is clean and the surprisingly so was the bathroom the problem is that the people working there are young and inexperienced they lack attention to detail and dont understand what it means to actually clean a car when i got my car the trunk was dirty they never even opened it to vacuum it the seems of the door were all full of dirt they didnt even bother to swipe it with a rag to take he dirt off the worst part is that it was obvious there is no way they could have missed it also the car isnt hand washed its passed through a machine just like the one at the gas station except these guys charge more all i can say is that i wont be coming back and anyone that expects to get what they paid for should also not come here you will be highly disappointed|0

horrible customer service cheap product i first stumbled upon them through kijiji and purchase a bed i confirmed with them many times if the bed was solid wood and they said yes every time the bed turned out to be edf second they had scheduled delivery on a wednesday and said they would confirm with me monday or tuesday i called and left voicemail and nothing in return finally i called again on wednesday and they said they had to reschedule to friday no apologies nothing i let it slide again as i was in the midst of moving and didnt have time to argue they came on friday and delivered and installed the bed everything seemed fine however upon sleeping once on the bed it seems shaky and the front legs dont fully touch the ground again im not one to complain and i didnt because i was thinking i paid only 250 for everything delivery and installation included which may be a lot for some people ive been on the hunt for a white bench and i came across their website again and saw that they carried it paul the owner of di bros promised to give me a discount on the chairs when i decide to order as they didnt have the one i initially wanted when i ordered the bed upon trying to reach their telephone for two days their line wasnt working so i emailed them asking about the specific piece of furniture i received a response shortly with a different contact number and when i asked about the product and if i would receive additional discount not only did they refuse the discount they also said the price of the bench now went up to 72 it was 56 two hours ago seems like they read my email and changed the price on their website immediately to make some more cash i told him i had a screenshot of a different price from two hours ago and he said it wasnt up to them and the price automatically changes it was all nonsense i have my own business and my own website regardless of the price change from manufacturers i have to manually change my own websites pricing and theirs isnt connected to their manufacturers in any way regardless if the price did magically change they should have honoured it for the customer overall it was horrible work ethics and poor customer service save your money and go order from a more reputable company that wouldnt try to suck the money out of you when you show interest in one of their products|0
they told me to come in 15 minutes early to my appointment which i did however they made me wait in the lobby for an hour then they finally called me to the room just to wait for another 15 to 20 minutes when do nal bone finally showed up they just barged in without knocking he has with him an assistant and a nurse i waited for over an hour just to be seen for less than a minute he didnt smile he wasnt friendly and seems to be very arrogant him and his nurse left the room and the other assistant who was typing on the computer was left behind i told him that you guys didnt even take my blood pressure he apologize and brought out a wrist blood pressure checker i told him i have the same one at home and it is not accurate he said the same thing he said this is not accurate but he used it anyway may be i should have gone elsewhere i paid 40 copy which i regret|0

went here today for dinner i ordered the seafood pasta from where the seating area is you can see the kitchen as well as the chef preparing meals as i was watching i saw the chef open up a large bag of frozen seafood im going to assume it was shrimp the same shrimp that ended up in my plate the seafood dish consisted of a tomato sauce but looked more like red food colouring the shrimp was also lukewarm and parts of my pasta was colder than others the boyfriend ordered the rack of lamb in medium rare it was okay but he expressed still feeling hungry not sure if he was just being a fatty or the portion size was too small i was really excited to try out this restaurant and finally my boyfriend took me today but unfortunately was let down overall the staff was nice the ambiance was nice as well but the food was disappointing|0
i have visited this store a few times yes the pricing is a bit high but the food is high quality and the selection is good we lost a dog due to a food allergy that the previous owner allowed to go on too long so we dont mind paying a bit extra for something that isnt made out of crushed up horse hooves and grain the owner was pleasant enough we chatted about pit bulls for a while and he made some suggestions on other items in the store i will definitely return|1
i do not know how i should start to revile this hotel ill try to be as unbiased as i can first off my dad has made a reservation on booking before he let me know in spite of lack knowledge i did not intend to google this hotel this hotel is located in downtown thats only thing that i could say as a positive about this hotel theres no bell boy to pick your lavage up to upstairs you gotta carry them to your room which pretty uncomfortable particularly you have heavy and lots luggages thankfully hotel has its own closed park area however it is not available by escalators you gotta climb stairs and go outside thereafter youll enter hotel thats pretty uncomfortable in winter time though distance is short hotel has free wifi thats true probably they wont mention pace internet which is really so poor rooms are not clear enough id not even suggest this hotel to my enemy stay away from it before you regret it like me|0

i scheduled an appointment 3 weeks in advance i never got a confirmation call or text i had a 300 appointment in my calendar with a 230 arrival time im not sure where the mistake was made but the office had a different time for my appointment according to the receptionist my appointment was for 930 with a 900 arrival i only figured this out because i happened to call 20 minutes prior to my actual appointment arrival time since i hadnt heard from them since i made the appointment 3 weeks prior when the receptionist told me i was supposed to be there at 900 i told her i would leave right then and be there in 15 minutes which would have put me into an arrival time of 905 the receptionist told me that my arrival time needed to be at 900 i told her i could do paperwork in 20 minutes instead of 30 and she continued to argue she had no interest in helping me she was rude and i decided that may be this doctor wasnt right for me anyway i just wish i hadnt waisted 3 weeks waiting for this appointment|0
i been a customer of boa for almost 20 years i was very disappointed with customer service i just received by a relationship manager jeremiah the chandler location is big trouble if this how he talks to his customer rather then trying to spend time to actually understand my concerns he was more argumentative i did not understand his approach i can take my money to any bank it is his job to make sure that you dont loose my business but he was more in la la land he kept arguing with me i decided to my saving account will be closing my checking and all my credits it hurts me because i have along history with boa and i have a built a very solid credit with them|0

we had our sons first hair cut at melon head yonge and clinton location it was great experience but this time at mark ville mall was totally disappointed and very unpleasant we came all the way from richmond hill to this location planning to go to the nearby garden basket for fresh groceries after but we have to rush home to clean our son who has little hair all over his head clothes and socks the stylist who cut his hair is emotionless she didnt say hi and introduce herself to my son and myself she just threw the cover over my sons neck and started to cut in a rough way tossing the hair over the hair thats why we found so many small hair over his head clothes and socks after we left the shop at one point i almost want to stop her i wish i did i just wanted to finish quick didnt even bother to point out the uneven cut when its all finished i still politely said thank you to her but she just gave us a glance without saying a word the whole time she has such unhappy face and unpleasant attitude i wonder how can someone like this can work with kids she seems the only one who looks like this in that shop while we were at the cashier we saw another stylist greeting another kid we dont know her name because she didnt tell us she seems the only asian looking lady in the shop|0

horrible customer service called for delivery to crescent heights it clearly states on their menu they deliver to this area was told my address was pushing the limits and not even given an option to pay more for a delivery fee which i happily wouldve done if i had been treated nicer i google mapped it after the phone call and it was 31 am and a 7 min drive guess the 01 over their limit is too much for them obviously this place does not care to bring more revenue to their business doesnt matter how good your pizza is supposed to be if u continue to treat customers like this|0

these guys ripped me off i paid for a gift card to have my wifes wheels coated as her christmas gift after countless phone calls and text messages i drove to the shop to find the guys packing up their equipment they reassured me that they were just moving locations long story short after many more phone calls and text messages they promised to refund my money well as i expected i never received a refund thanks for scamming us out of a christmas gift powder coat shop if these guys ever do reopen do not use them they have no integrity|0
cafe 1100 express has become a lunch time staple for my office theyve got great wraps and a good variety at good prices the balsamic turkey wrap is a popular one around here and i like the greek chicken and the gyro as well ive been getting food here for over a year now and theyve been consistently good one time they messed up one of our wraps but they offered to remake the wrap right away and gave us a free one for next time id definitely recommend any of their wraps and the fries are pretty good too but dont go for the chili its the only thing ive had here that was bad|1
got a discount for this review i totally recommend the prices here are on point and the staff here are very helpful|1

the doctor was fine their billing department needs some additional training kept sending me bills because they didnt follow proper procedure when billing primary insurance first and then secondary then the billing personnel took it personnal when i tried to correct her on her mistake also wanted money down before even looking at my insurance and my copy will never go back due their inability to bill correctly and their customer service my mother and husband had the same problem with their billing service too|0
this is hands down our favorite comfort food in kent excellent quality freshly prepared homemade home cooking yes you have to sit at the water street tavern if you want to eat in its ok theyre family friendly weve brought our preschoolers with us as long as its early enough and weve seen other kids there too the food is not fancy and its served on plastic plates paper trays and occasionally a pizza pan but it is so good and so reasonably priced that you wont care or you could get take out if you do be sure to go when the smokers parked out front because the specials are amazing but even their regular menu is worth it weve liked everything weve tried but our favorites are the pulled pork po boys the crazy daves fries french fries with beef drippings horseradish sauce and who knows what else so good and the cobb salad go enjoy|1
drove by on 142013 and now the place is called spur saloon looks like the same owners its been 3 different bars in about 3 years now|0
my families experience with newberry i at a academy was quite disappointing on our first visit we were put in a small room with one of the lead instructors who used pushy hard sell tactics in front of our child we should have walked away but we were put in such a compromising position with our child present after joining the academy our child was rushed through belt levels and it seemed as if we were being forced to spend a lot of money every other week we finally had to stop going out of concern for our childs safety but we kept paying that iron clad contract|0
while the stay was fine i was slightly upset to learn that the stay would not be credited to my hilton honors account due to my wife making the booking through a third party website that being said she normally does not book the hotels and did not know and i was not available to book the reservation at the time the hotel did not have to accomodate my late request but i know it is at the hotels discretion to make this decision they just insured that a diamond member will go elsewhere from now on|0
brat und bra has wonderful customer service from the time you come in until the time you leave the food is delicious and the portions are over exceeding i have been going to this restuarant since i was little and still today this the cottage fries and the homemade onion straws are the best in town i encourage couples families and others to try this family establishment you wont be disappointed|1
today would normally be the day that im covered in itchy red razor burn kicking myself for even trying to shave my bikini line and wondering if i can change beauty standards about pubic hair single handed but since i went to sugar haven for my est sugaring appointment extended bikini i am not dying of red bumps it was a bit uncomfortable to have done ive never done waxing so no comparison but the results were worth it a little aloe aftercare and loose clothing now im ready to confidently hit the beach for the first time ever thank you sugar haven the staff is professional sensitive efficient and not thrown off by natural hair i am genuinely excited for my next appointment|1

was hesitant between two and one star but left it at two as waitress was quite accommodate was visiting toronto for professional event wanted to do lunch seemed like this place was the only game in town for a dairy restaurant not pizza the place is drab the decor is very questionable with extra cords from the lights been rolled and exposed everywhere they only had one waitress hostess barista bartender when we came everything was understandably pretty slow we sat near the window and booth was vibrating so had to change the table my plates and utensils were dirty like literally oily all over the last straw was the olive tapenade we got our butter olive oil tapenade for the bread and something was pretty smelly when i tried the tapenade i figure out what it was they left it outside without the fridge and it got sour we stood up and left and agent to a place next door this place is sad it either needs to close or change the owners|0
if your e in the mood for tacos and in downtown chandler you should stop by and check out their tacos its right next to the perch and has this giant mural on the side of the shop they have seating inside and outside and i was surprised by the amount of seating this place had when i was looking on yelp it didnt look like this place had a lot of seating and i was kinda worried that we would have to wait long since we came on a saturday evening for dinner however that wasnt the case and we were able to order and sit down right away i ordered a carne asada and fish taco and my husband got the carne asada green chili and fish tacos theyre street tacos so its smaller then regular tacos i would recommend getting the meal of 3 tacos because it comes with a drink and a side of beans rice mixed you can ask for the rice and be an to be separate but i feel like you usually end up mixing the two together anyways so we didnt mind we also got an order of chips and guacamole and a small cheese quesadilla for our son the tacos had good flavor and we enjoyed our meal the rice and beans were a bit on the saltier side but still good i do wish this place offered more variety in salsa they only offered mild hot and pico de gallo it would have been better if they offered some green salsa and some jala pets for those who like some extra spice overall we enjoyed our food and will definitely be back|1
the service and support here is excellent no matter if you are a experienced runner or a novice just looking to get some exercise they do a great job helping you find the shoe that fits you well and meets your needs|1

for anyone who knows i barrow bonanza i new york pizzeria is basically a cheap imitation meant to feed drunk and or down on their luck lost wages visitors passing through the flamingo similar large slices thin and deep crust pizza limo overpriced and under seasoned while i cant judge their other offerings it was obvious amongst co diners that the za was nothing more than a late night fix for folks cutting through or returning to their hotel after an after hours bar crawl the pizza sits on warmers waiting to be thrown in an oven and reheated end result is a bland watery attempt at new york thin crust for 700 dont waste your time unless its meant to fight of a rough migraine in the morning|0
loving hut i love you i have been enjoying this restaurant for over 15 years formerly the vegetarian house years later i see familiar faces still working there smiling and hospitable this is probably the original vegan restaurant in the valley and has never disappointed me|1

horrible service our food was coughed on and brought to another table before it reached us grossed out we asked our waiter sean to have them remade he made condescending comments towards us and treated us as if we were homeless begging for a meal then he returned to the kitchen and brought out a freshly cooked set of wings and fries that were cold to the touch clearly this was the exact same meal frustrated and hungry we left i followed up the next day with the district manager but because he wasnt the franchise manager he said he couldnt do anything to remedy the situation furthermore he strongly advised against me speaking with the franchise manager at the king church restaurant donna he informed me that she defended means actions and had no intention of issuing any kind of disciplinary action very disgusted with the way they treat customers here unfortunately this wasnt the first time but it certainly was the tipping point for me|0
ok i usually love cookout and when i saw the other review before i went i was like ok they must have been having a off day but i just came from getting food there and the food is good but i didnt ask for fries i asked for chicken nuggets as one of my sides disappointed but in the girls defense that was running the window the speaker at the drive thru needs to be replaced its very hard to hear her so im sure she couldnt hear me either|0
the worst front office ever after surgery i bought glasses from them the glasses i got were not what i ordered they offered to take them back for a full refund but i have been waiting 8 weeks they said a week or two but may be as long as 8 weeks because they are such a large company now after 8 weeks they said may be they could credit my credit card because a check will take some time they just want to keep my money 8 weeks and no refund|0

the dry cleaning is acceptable but the service is horrendous apparently two people work at this location the young man is great but watch out if the woman works she seems to take time off whenever she wants and closes the door i have on more than one occasion tried to pick up my cleaning and had to wait from 1020 minutes i do understand if you are the only worker that you might have to close for lunch however just post times you will be closed so it does not keep your customers waiting and guessing|0

worst daycare that ive ever encountered it was my sons first time at a daycare center after being at home with me i came to find him in a corner crying his eyes out in a dark room by himself with an extremely full diaper the teacher said that she has put him there so that the other kids dont start crying thats just ridiculous i do not know how long he was crying but his eyes were very swollen i will never bring him back and i would not trust them with children they have no heart|0
i unfortunately had to put my do to sleep on may with due to renal failure as traumatic as that was the vet was extremely compassionate during the entire process i signed the forms to have my dog cremated in a private cremation paid the fees and left their establishment as distraught as i left i didnt ask how long it would take to get my dog back i called the following wednesday to be told that my dogs remains would be brought back on friday june ith after not getting a call during that day i called to follow up to be told that the process usually was from 710 business days and that my dogs remains would be back by the ith of june most of the ith went by and i decided to call via to find out if my dogs remains had made it back jenna who answered the phone put me on a long hold as she was looking for my dogs ashes she came back and said i will have to call you back since i can not locate her ashes and i have to go check in another room with the overflow ashes at that time i panicked since they didnt know my dogs ashes whereabouts i did receive a call a few minutes later to only tell me that my dog had yet to be cremated due to a delay at that point i lost it as 10 days had gone by and my dog had not been cremated the longer i talked to jenna the more lies i was told first that due to not knowing how to spell my dogs first and last name that there was a delay now what kind of joke is that 10 day delay due to a name when i asked to speak to a manager she told me that no one was around she failed to tell me that she herself was a supervisor i finally got her to have her manager megan call me even though she was in another state for a supposed conference the manager tried to cover for her supervisor by trying to reassure me that its never happened before i asked why i wasnt informed that there was a delay to which she couldnt give me an explanation she promised to look into it the next day even though she herself said there was an emergency after hours number as the manager of the hospital you would figure that she would have the managers personal number for the crematorium that she sends all her dead pets to that of course was not an option i have lost all trust in this place that initially showed compassion now i am left to continue grieving for my pet while she is lost out there somewhere i wouldnt recommend this place to my worst enemy|0

pizza was ok but we ordered a steak hoagie with cheese whiz because its rare to find that and its my favorite way to have a steak hoagie when we got home found out there was no cheese whiz it was just your typical nasty cheese sauce which completely ruined the hoagie we threw it all away waste of 10 will never go again dont advertise you use cheese whiz if its not that|0
i sought ibble expertise after having consulted with two different clas in the area and feeling really unsatisfied with their recommendations it was a last ditch effort after having been pumping and bottle feeding my newborn for 5 weeks due to painful latch autumn and laura took their time and did a super thorough evaluation although they like the clas who i saw also suspected my baby had ties that were affecting his feeding they gave me tools to help improve his latch while i was consulting with pediatric dentistry and chiropractic regarding diagnosis and revision of any ties the other lactation consultants in town basically said get the ties revised and then come see me which was super frustrating my baby is taking all his feedings from the breast now at 8 weeks old after 5 weeks of exclusively bottle feeding his ties have not yet been revised again the clas would not even help me until i had my newborn sons mouth surgically altered which to me is a huge decision not to be taken lightly things that i love about autumn and laura their office is super nice and comfortable its inside a pediatric dentists office though so to keep me from feeling lost and confused they had me text them when they arrived and autumn came out to meet me i heard autumn say several times ultimately the most important thing is to feed the baby however that needs to happen i loved that i feel like sometimes there is so much pressure to breastfeed and while there was never any suggestion that i was not enough or that i should stop trying it reassured me that i was not failing by giving a bottle when baby and i were both frustrated they both made it a point to always announce that they were about to go wash their hands before they touched my baby they dont have a sink in the actual consultation room so as a new mom and a former preemie mom i really appreciated that excellent but no pressure follow up we scheduled a follow up phone call after my baby was feeding well at the breast and she put it on me to do the calling which i actually loved because im one of those people who basically never answers my phone because i prefer texting i spaced the call and she didnt call me 50 times or get mad she just sent a sweet text reminding me that we had planned to chat and told me to contact her when i could she made time to speak with me later that day i could go on and on but this review is already super long i am so grateful for these ladies and i definitely recommend their services to every new mom i wish i had seen them when my baby was 2 days old and we had just started having trouble|1
there is a bit of a learning curve but the effort is worth it the orbit is great|1

dean care health care is so disappointing no one could run a successful business following the way they treat there customers all they care about is how much money they make my son had dean care insurance for several years and had a temporary lapse in coverage his coverage was to start again in a few weeks and went in for a routine checkup for medication he had been on for 3 years the nurse practitioners knew he was not covered until the following month but ordered a unnecessary urine test without telling him that the test was 2000 how can anyone do that i it seems criminal and when you call the billing department they reduced it to a mere 1500 like thats a deal shame on you dean care you should always disclose cost when your ordering test your cost are insanely high|0
my wife and i just recently closed escrow on our home and metz home inspection did our inspection luke was completely thorough when inspecting our home he checked all the outlets to the roof of the house we went over everything that could potentially be a problem and he pointed out things in our home that were recently upgraded at the end of it all we sat down and he went over the entire report at the end i had no questions or concerns i would recommend metz home inspection highly to anyone|1
this used to be my place to go in a pinch when i needed something fast or on a sunday but not any more even though they have hire prices then other wholesale places they still would have what i would need when i needed it before they used to let you get one or two things if needed but now they say you have to buy a set amount if your in the cell phone business and want to stock up on accessories or need something fast just go down the street to an is on with ave and cowell red next to subway they have the best prices and better staffed|0
holy crap the food here is amazing when i came here with my coworker he decided to order us two double cheeseburgers chili cheese fries and a philly cheese steak sandwich it was coma inducing goodness the burger patties tasted so fresh and juicy and the ca banks sauce is awesome the chili cheese fries were covered in tons of ground beef and cheese and still managed to stay pretty crispy i could only muster a few bites of the philly cheese steak at that point but it was also really good and well made will definitely come back and bring more to help me eat through everything|1
went in to this location today a little skeptical after reading the other reviews i was professionally greeted when i walked in and was checked on by all of the employees working at one time or another during my visit asked to try on two different pairs of shoes i was only brought one of each but at least the car didnt bring me two left or two right so i was able to try on both and compare it was at this time i noticed they have no mirrors in the store which is a little different since most would like to see how the shoes look while your wearing them from a different vantage point other then from directly above regardless i made my choice and went to the counter to pay dude at the register was super nice and friendly carried on a casual convo about the store and all ifl players that shop there and he even gave me some tips on shoe cleaner all in all it was a easy and enjoyable experience i know everyone is entitled to there opinion but some of the complaints in the other reviews blow my mind i manage a store with similar customer service issues their return policy is their policy if you dont like it go to nordstrom or amazon theyll take back anything and when you get a slightly used pair of shoes from them youll be pissed then too id rather have a brand new pair then a pair someone else i have no idea about wore whether they wore them for 5 minutes or 5 days its shoes and people got some stank feet and how are you going to complain about finding something cheaper online do you not have a smart phone dont blame a store for your lack of research their selection is great and they have a lot of shoes you wont find at footlocker or finish line shoe palace gets 5 stars from me because they deserve it|1
they started out great and could get us in at a moments notice next time i call they gave me an appointment five days later beware cut was ok but never what i wanted exactly i changed locations to a different groomer and they got us in right away not to mention did exactly what i wanted my dogs have never looked cuter or prettier|0

warning read this review if you are considering using these people i literally just sent this exact message in an email to culinary pros i would never in my life suggest working with them i just want to let you all know that we are not only extremely disgusted with the unauthorized purchases to our room by your staff members which we have timestamp receipts to prove for you yelp ers we had our reception in suite at palms place penthouse and the culinary pros staff members decided to order 150 worth of stuff we didnt want need authorize only 5 minutes after my husband got in a limo to get to our wedding ceremony but the customer service that the owner of the company showed during our issue was inconceivable she was extremely unprofessional and unwilling to listen to the issue and solve the problem it was excuse after excuse with no follow up not only were the unauthorized charges a unfathomable issue but the services we did receive were not at all up to par i literally typed up a one page schedule to do list of what these professionals had to do and tina beavers may be did one thing right all night she was also drinking on the job which i would have mentioned during our conversation had there been any listening from your end i will personally do everything in my power to ensure nobody ever has to deal with your company again need i mention that i sent my schedule to do list in advance and an hour after it was confirmed with perfect timing with the email tina was sitting right here i gave her a copy of both attachments you sent that was very helpful i know your day will be perfect funny because neither tina or the bartender had any idea where or when they were even supposed to arrive and had no idea what they were supposed to do if you asked anybody that was involved in my wedding in any way i was the most chill down to earth bride that walked the planet on may 19 i am by no means over exaggerating this was just that bad|0

my wife and i had a tremendous experience with countertop rock it started when we met with anthony thomas at his office he was extremely knowledgeable and professional there were numerous countertop samples on site once we picked a sample anthony was able to work the installation in to our very tight schedule the installation team came to the home on time on the scheduled day of installation and did an outstanding job they were courteous professional and asked us questions to make sure the install met our every expectation they were even gracious enough to cut a bathroom countertop that we previously had on site at no additional cost we could not be happier with the quality of the product the cost or the countertop rock team of professionals we would highly recommend countertop rock to anyone looking for a positive no pressure affordable experience|1

spacious place with nice atmosphere had their summer in the city which is a sweet cocktail i would suggest to order to whoever like sweet cocktails smoked gouda entre which was in my opinion not the tastiest but still it is served in an impressive way pretzel bites and granny smith slices with a melted gouda cheese in a pot like a fondue with a candle beneath and margherita flatbread which was really delicious you can not go wrong with margherita waitress was very friendly and took care of us pretty well not a sushi person and didnt find too many meals in the ordinary menu to my liking so that would be the only drawback other than that a nice place to go to|1
my daughter took the sat course and her score did not improve at all we were very disappointed and had been hoping for the 200 point increase that they promised she is an excellent student attended all but one class she was sick and took the practice tests the teacher did not seem helpful when my daughter said her scores were staying the same the company has been difficult about honoring their money back guarantee and needed proof of her score before taking the class this is in their fine print as she had not taken the test before the class this was not possible save your money and take a better class|0
first time here and it looks like im the first review they also go by mars el as barbershop so lets start with my arrival i am out on a saturday looking for a haircut so most barber shops are packed i see this place is relatively new so i give them a call a women answers and i ask how long the wait is she said there is no wait i get there 15 minutes later and i find there are 5 people in front of me i am promptly greeted and i am asked to sign in i find the sheet and see there isnt anyone signed in between the time i called in and the time i sign in but there are 5 people waiting so i sign in and wait as i wait other people walk in and sign in after me so as time goes by and other people finish the people who just walked in after are called up first i mention i was there first but they explain if i request some one in particular they get service first even though they dont accept appointments i found this waiting process to be frustrating but i had no other choice but to wait as i wait and i was finally called all the barbers speak spanish i dont have the typical look so they had no idea i also speak spanish so i got to have pleasure of hearing then talking crap about me as they cut me hair haircut was 1200 then a fee for paying with a card of 50 it would be safe to say i didnt leave a tip never again save yourself and dont go|0
i have never had an experience at a car repair place where the manager was so laid back and out of touch with the customer i was getting new pads and rotors on my vow and dropped my car off in the morning on a saturday when i dropped it off i was told it would be completed that day i was told they would call me when its ready and i told them my son would come pick up the car before they closed at 6 at 430 i called for an update and i was abruptly told that they would have to call me back no big deal time goes by no call back i call again close to 6 and tell them i need to arrange for my son to pick up the car and ask if its ready they tell me they dont know when its going to be ready its 6 oclock now and you dont know he keeps telling me he has to call me back i tell them that it unacceptable since you close at 6 and my son is on his way he does not tell me they are going to work late nor does he tell me the car wont be ready till monday at this point i am fuming at the lack of consideration and communication i am being inconvenienced now and no answers the manager was young and inexperienced and way too laid back to deliver bad news to customers i would of understood if the situation was explained to me and i wasnt continually told they had to call me back this after last week i had to take my sons car back there to get the bottom plastic sheath put back on after falling off while driving after getting an oil change i will never go to this place again|0

you are not getting what you pay for they can not even pronounce my childs name correctly even after repeated correction they will tell you your child has issues and developmental delays when your own doctors and specialists will reassure you your child is perfectly normal they will largely over step their bounds and try to contact county services for learning and speech without letting you know or asking you first not sure what paper work they sent in yet it is not their place to do so as we have specialists on retainer in case yet they never asked livid contacting the owner to help resolve issues not okay|0

the pieces are pricey which is expected as i know from experience its supposed to be something relaxing to do on a weekday evening so i pay the price this time was anything but relaxing i went to this location a week ago and they didnt seem to want to pay any attention to my friend as they had two other big groups i know what to do so i go ahead they arent fully stocked in all the supplies that are needed and theyre too busy to give any help to find them the items i did find were clogged or didnt work it was around closing time that they were able to give me and my friend attention and that was to rush us to pay instead of helping me fix the clogged paints she decided to rush me to pay so that she could close whats most frustrating is that one of the workers just kept on taking stuff that i was using and giving it to the other parties she didnt find the need to ask each time she took things away from me she took the ones that i worked so hard to fix there were more of the items on the shelf but she decided that i didnt need them their item are in rough shape and they dont seem to care the paints that need to be less concentrated arent and the paints that need to be more concentrated arent it either clumps or runs ruining your piece i got my piece back and everything has runny streaks over it theres also their writing on my piece that has been glazed over i can spend that kind of money elsewhere without the stress and frustration|0

this review is for a purchase made several months ago it was not done immediately because at that time i thought to let an issue go after further consideration i am writing this review thinking it may get back to management owners furniture ordered was a couch and a couple chairs we spent a very long time looking for something comfortable and finally found it at salt creek special order so we waited the 68 weeks got a call that delivery was scheduled for a saturday between 3 5 am and we would get a call when they were an hour out we had dinner plans for 7 that night so figured it was all good up and no call i tried calling the store but of course they were closed then tried calling the number for deliveries and got a message their normal hours were during the week left messages inquiring as to where the delivery truck was and how much longer 630 we decided to go and thats when the truck pulled up driver got out said he had our furniture i asked about the call we should have gotten and he said they were busy i then said it would have been nice to let us know they were running late since we had dinner plans and his response was what you want me to drop what im doing so i can call customers i told him the delivery was scheduled for between 3 5 and his reply was so why you disrespecting me you want your furniture or not i replied we are the customers who pay his wages and we were the ones disrespected because we didnt get the curtesy call and had to sit and wait since we had spent a long time looking for the furniture i told him to bring it in the delivery company was miranda delivery service the part that bothers my wife and myself most is after we both left messages at salt creek we received absolutely no call back from the store evidently the furniture was delivered so everything was good as far as they were concerned very disappointing we wont be back|0

first time my wife and i ate here was a month or two ago didnt realize they were about to close but staff was incredibly friendly and insisted we stay for our meal we got two specials and everything was awesome batter was light and crispy fish was moist chips were nice and chunky tartar sauce and coleslaw were to die for everything seems to be made in house including the tartar sauce none of that bland tear open pack stuff portions are insane in the best way possible im a man with an appetite and the last couple chips are always a struggle first impressions were great but the exceptionally friendly staff good food and great value for money is what keeps us coming back|1

came in on a saturday i arrived 7 minutes before they opened and had 5 people in front of me waiting despite feeling like i should have come in earlier the staff knocked the patients out so quickly i came in for a 3 hour blood draw and am so appreciative of the attentiveness off the ladies i worked with my first draw was at 815a to give you an idea of how long i actually waited with those 5 others in front of me they had a room i comfy chairs for me to wait in gave me the wifi password and overall seemed really sympathetic of the fact that i had to be there for so long a couple of things however i had to remind them when my first hour was up they said they had an alarm set but someone may have turned it off so im glad i was watching the clock i also would have appreciated some more guidance to apply pressure on my veins after each draw i did bruise a little on the first as i didnt think about it and didnt get the arm band sticky thing|1

pros they arrived on time items packed by the team leader scott were well packed labelled cons 2185 of damaged or lost items still awaiting reimbursement or reply from the company many items were damaged due to poor packing doesnt include cosmetic damage like scratches to computer case or portable ac update after posting online reviews i did receive a call from the company owner and a check for 2185 i opted for the full replacement value and have emails from their long distance moving coordinator to that effect however they attempted to claim that i only had the minimum insurance until i sent copies of emails fragile artwork was literally strapped to the outside of the truck for a cross country move and received water damage from rain as well as damage from poor packing and you know being strapped to the outside of a truck for a 2500 mile move furniture also strapped to outside of truck also received water damage did not receive a household inventory as required finally i just got a notice of fines from the illinois hallway for moving ahead services blowing through toll booths without paying the camera recorded the license plate of my car being towed by moving ahead so the fines came to me i used one of the big name moving companies for my move from portland to cleveland 8 years ago i did not have any of the above problems with the big name mover the only damage on the move out was one handle of a coffee cup came off this included moving all the same artwork etc knowing that id be working with a different local agent in cleveland for the move back i figured id give a local company a try they low balled the initial claim did not respond to phone calls or emails in a timely fashion eg ill get back to you in a minute in email translates to some time period greater than a week|0

ive been a customer for almost 30 years why did i stay trust me after today im done every interaction is a nightmare received a solicitation for my home equity line that stated in bold print that i could get additional checks for i low promotional rate by calling their alleged customer service a complete lie even betty at the harbour office went through the four phone calls without success only after i left her after more than an hour and then called back to ask how i could contact executive management did i get a message from the idiot craig kirkland who signed the letter to me stating i could get additional checks just by calling one number too late trust me letters to everyone above craig are forthcoming to point out his obvious incompetent oh i forgot to mention that another bank ive never dealt with felt i was a more desirable and valuable customer so they offered me a lower interest rate than nab offered with their alleged promotional rate why is anyone their customer i know ive finally learned my lesson the hard way|0

we finally came here on a saturday morning to try their infamous tacos made with their freshly made corn tortillas the tacos did not disappoint we tried the chorizo asada carnitas and pastor tacos they were all delicious but my favorites were probably the chorizo and the carnitas almost everyone in the store was there for the counter in the back either buying meat and tortillas in bulk or buying tacos quesadillas soup to eat in the store like us we loved all the different salsa they had out on the table including guacamole and everyone there was incredibly nice the drinks are all self service so you grab what you want from the fridge and then pay for everything at the end we will definitely be coming back soon to try some of the other items on the menu and to stock up on the carnitas|1
we ordered delivery be aware the delivery time was twice the time we were quoted pizza was delivered cold and missing garlic bread we ordered upon calling they offered 20 off our next order adding a credit for the missing bread not quite what i would expect given i was delivered what amounted to a take and bake pizza poor quality and worse poor response to the problem|0

this place doesnt know what it wants to be formal dining smooth greek music lounge or quick sandwiches slow service probably the formal dining experience theyre shooting for and ok food nothing spectacular theres also a greek mafia feel to the place i dont even know if thats a thing but there are various older gentlemen around wearing gold chains and button down shirts half unbuttoned who seem to be doing business|0

30 minute wait to be seated 35 minutes for food to arrive we order basic breakfast items pancakes were just average was hoping for more than simply apple pie filling and raisins tossed on top i can make that the food as okay but pricey 4 adults 92 items got missed on our order items arrived late as well sunset grill is a much better bet and value faster service and better prices seems other reviews share similar experiences|0
worst experience of my entire life george down at my auto body is 100 dishonest and does not follow through with any personal guarantees he made at the onset he tried to overcharge my insurance company and worst yet they did the worst fix ever the repair was so bad i didnt even feel comfortable driving my car any more the body work still showed signs of bondo applications and misalignment panels and short of masking tape and superglue he uses the cheapest replacement parts used etc known to mankind he even went to the extent of installing pep boys stick on chrome trim as my fender trim which didnt even match the rest of the car can you believe it when confronted he had no excuse except that the car would not leave until the job was paid in full even though any reputable body shop would never let a car back to the customer is such subpar condition the fact that he claims to be a professional body man is beyond me id actually consider suing him for such shoddy work but ill let my insurance take that course of action i ended up taking my car to a reputable repair center to get the entire job redone correctly unfortunately at my expense do yourself a favor and stay away from my life is to short and precious to put your your life in the hands of unqualified idiots just goes to show you any idiot can hang a shingle out in front in this case a banner and claim to know what theyre doing i guess my first clue should have been the absence of any tools in his shop and less than professional sons that all work there looking to scam their next victim shame on me for not reading the signs shame on my for claiming to be a body repair center someone is going to get hurt by these guys if the state doesnt insist on some licensing checks and balances if there was even a prototypical scam center that gives the auto repair business a bad name you have found the poster children here at my|0

i found the nurses that i dealt with and one in particular to be really great overall though id have to say its sort of like a factory assembly line belt i had as it turned out 3 broken bones in my foot like a lot of us you figure its just sprained elevate it ice etc but when after a week it was still very swollen and bruised i went to the walk in at being prompted by colleagues they saw me late in the day sent me for rays across the street at york adelaide which facility was closed by 5 so i went the next day they did xray but couldnt fit me in for an ink ultrasound for 5 days by then i was in horrible pain got the ultrasound today and then ordered an additional xray of the foot realizing that the previous xray ordered by clinic was not what was read not ankle but foot bow the imaging facility terrific thorough back to walk in for followup doc hadnt read the latest results and said i was okay but to stay off the foot and ice it after i updated the doctor she opened the file which only contained last weeks results and read it they had actually lost my entire file and only had these older results so i provided a ad of to days results and they still hadnt found the fax sent to them this day from imaging co horribly frustrating for me bottom line i should have gone to an emergency department go to them only minor issues|0

ive been here three times now and the service and food have both been meh first time i ordered a slice of pepperoni pizza it took a few minutes to come out from the kitchen and it clearly looked like they had reheated a slice that had been sitting for a while i decide to give it another try but the next time i went in and ordered a slice of pepperoni pizza i was told they didnt have any pepperoni i got the plain cheese and again it was a barely reheated slice that had been sitting for a long time on my third visit i skip the pizza and order a greek salad no onions to go i get home and the thing practically had half an onion worth of slices on it what it didnt have was any dressing i paid 1099 for a salad covered in nasty onions and with no dressing lesson learned i wont be back|0

i come to this walmart location frequently because its close to where i live ive been coming here for a year now i cant say much for the store the way the store is ran lines backed up with only 2 lanes open crappy money center the grocery pick up is beyond pointless i came in yesterday evening to pick up my groceries i ordered online the previous day well you call the number that they tell you to call and when you do multiple times going unanswered finally going inside to tell someone im here to pick up my order which after all said done it took them 30 minutes to come outside to my vehicle walmart is very unprofessional as a brand|0
was there yesterday afternoon and he was just making some fresh mild italian sausages so decided to pick up apcs plus some pea meal bacon and smoked bacon the place has only been around for 7 months so still new to the area tried both the pea meal bacon and italian sausage today and going back next weekend to order more the pea meal bacon actually tasted like pork and not salted meat like others ive tried and ive tried a lot all over the city it was so nice for breakfast this morning i wished i had bought more yesterday the italian sausage was for dinner and it was meaty not just fatty ground pork and again not made to last months in the fridge ie overly salty just the right amount of heat for mild and tasted great i had so many requests for extra that i ran out i have found the place for sausage and bacon and couldnt be happier|1

this place is horrible only two cars ahead of me in the drive thru and no customers inside yet it took 35 minutes to get a two quarter pounders and a large fry the order speaker was so low they could barely hear me and i could barely hear the employee the employee at the window took 10 minutes to retake my order i have no clue what confused her but the attitude wasnt necessary finally the manager came over and ran my debit card i sat another 10 or so minutes before they handed me my food when i got home the quarter pounders were cold as were the fries i dont even want to think about how long it would have took if the place was even halfway busy yea tear it down|0
do not go here i went with my mom and while our nails were being painted or nails they all talked amongst themselves and did not talk to us that is until some customers walked out they then told us about how they stole from them and the person painting my moms toes got up and went after them one of the women came back and started screaming while our nail techs continued to drag us into the situation the lady painting my nails was quite racist and said that its only black people who steal that was ridiculous and i was beyond annoyed then the person painting my moms toes came back and just stared out the door and did not finish her work until she asked for them to hurry as we needed to leave after that crazy experience all we wanted to do was leave and we left and i thought they did good on our nails but we still said not to return after 2 days my nails started chipping it was truly the worst experience ive had at a nail salon and i will never return or recommend anyone else to|0

i booked a car for a week in june through expedite ca with european in mid april and a month later received a vague email from expedite saying that i might have to pay more money for my rental as the price was likely higher i spent more than an hour on the phone with expedite and thankfully they stepped up and found me an alternate vehicle for the same price with a better provider but it was european that apparently raised the rate by more than 1000 which i didnt know until i called expedite and expedite had to save the day grateful to expedite but very annoyed with european i abysmal customer service and inability to keep agreements made with customers will never rent with european again|0

i had the pad thai with chicken and shrimp it was a big portion but he chicken and shrimp were dry and over cooked and i found it had a lot more tofu that was really needed the pad thai sauce tasted more like just plain old ketchup the dish was too sweet over all and missed the contrast of sally sweet and pungent that you normally find with pad thai the price was a little too high for this quality of food the restaurant seems new in the area so perhaps they are going through some fine tuning|0

so we went back on a monday night just as they opened for dinner we were the first in and seated pretty quick our seat was nice and warm at first and near the front of the restaurant for some unknown reason it became cold rather quickly our orders were started the waiter started to walk away after taking our appetizers and having had bad experience there prior we asked to put in entire order up front he obliged we ordered a cup of lobster bisque for the lady i ordered a caesar salad with anchovies on the side our appetizers were homemade pierogies and some kind of salmon ball delight which was truly delightful meals were grilled lamp chop and pan seared halibut a and couple came in about ten minutes after soup salad and appetizers but they were served main course prior to ours after we had already put in our choices this seemed quite odd but based on prior experience here not totally surprising our dessert was homemade blueberry ice cream and chocolate cake once again the overall selection was nothing spectacular the salmon special was really good and so was the lamb chop blue berry ice cream was easy as well the rest just seemed kind of plain the service again was kinda average and nothing blew me away i have to stick with a 2 on this place if i had spent full price we were there on another group on visit i would have most likely been more upset this place isnt bad but it just lacks inspiration i do miss the old ownership a lot|0

a relationship with god is deeply personal and has nothing to do with how cool a church is decorated how ever to people tolerate going to church in third world countries ugh or how amazing a singer is dove award singers only please if your e not there for the right reasons and allow your spirit to be fed with something from visiting with other believers then your e there to judge and people bash its not about the bricks and mortar its not even about the people its the walk and relationship that simple and anyone or any negative review of a church with anything less than they stole from me or the pastor punched me in the face is kind aka a little missing the point that that personal pursuit of worshiping god is personal if its not for you and your e looking for something different then you gently acknowledge that you need something different the next week geese and christians are supposed to be the judgemental ones|1

yum i didnt even know this place existed until i saw the group on for it yeah im that person who subscribes to group ons from other cities in preparation for my vacation knowing how vegas tends to be on the more spend side as opposed to lincoln ne we were fully prepared to pay over and above the group on value but first look at the menu i realized that they were actually really reasonably priced just a few dollars more than what id spend at a nice mexican restaurant here in lincoln we didnt have a reservation but we didnt have to wait at all they seated us immediately another thing we werent expecting but as ive said in other review vegas seemed to be a bit slow the week we were there i got my margarita seriously delicious and strong and delicious oh i already said that and they brought out our chips and salsa very good i preferred the green salsa but they all were good and i dont know what it is about mexican restaurants but entrees always come out super fast normally i take a bite or two of the rice and beans and thats it because they never really wow me and id rather save room for the entree but these were awesome and i ate pretty much all of it i could definitely tell they were fresh and werent sitting around all day i ordered the chicken tacos and i loved them i really wish i would have asked for them on flour tortillas though im not a big corn tortilla fan but it was still good overall i was pretty pleased|1

i want to like this place since it is the only place literally in mountains edge i have been to the bounty 612 times since it opened i spread the visits out with a dull hope of change the problem is it is nothing special lifeless and there are simply much bettter places that are close to frequent instead there are no beers on draft about the last of its kind in vegas no happy hour no drink specials and no food specials 4 for a bottle of bud once the cactus overpass opened and i received a flyer to come give them a try i thought perhaps it shall be another happy hour option for a coworker and myself nope not a good choice walked into a dead lifeless bar no specials 4 bottle of bud and i slunk ed away what other options are there that are close with happy hours and specials rounders home plate 2 lodges cactus rainbow off the strip barcelona tapas and bar montana and blue diamond bar those are simply the ones close of course if you are on foot you might be limited to the bounty|0
my experience with parker sons has been quite poor their technicians seem more interested in sales than repairs when i called this last time a repair person came to fix a simple problem of a strange noise he did not even try to hear what the nice sounded like he immediately went up into the attic and discovered thousands of dollars of maintenance and upgrades that were essential to the health of my ac units he said i needed to clean my evaporation coils and showed me a video from his i phone that he said showed how dirty they were a service technician had been out to check over our system about 8 weeks before and never mentioned the coils i grew suspicious talked to a supervisor the next day who sounded responsive and sympathetic he said he would get back to me and never did even thought i called a number of times but he was not available i brought in another company that got great reviews in our mountain bridge facebook site the owner came it took him 2 seconds to diagnose the problem as soon as he heard the noise and 5 minutes to fix it he then checked and told me my coils were clean we cancelled our contract with parker and sons their sales pitch sounds good but the reality for me was quite different|0
little vinci i how adorable is that my granddaughter is enrolled in miss maria painting class and i am amazed at the level of work being produced the students range from 69 years old the student to teacher ratio is about 51 to ensure quality and focused teachings the waiting area is clean and friendly and even has a monitor so you can watch your little vinci creating his or her masterpieces i like this place so much that i am going to try a paint and wine class for myself i know summer camps are available and im hoping the staff adds an option for intercession camp im so glad this place is close by i am a loyal customer|1
previous reviews have it right on the dot i went there for some good counter service before enjoying my evening with my boyfriend the guy behind the counter messed up our order and instantly became quite rude he then insisted that we pay extra because of his mistake after our transaction had gone through and had spent over twice as long waiting for his fish to come out he tend refuses to hand off the food that we have already paid for the whole experience got highly confrontational i suggest everyone avoid this place go somewhere else unless you want to be treated like garbage because the guys behind the counter cant get your order right|0

amazing new addition to the queen west trinity bell woods strip and my new go to for great greek fare in the area this is a tastefully done market safe with all your favourite greek treats what it isnt is a souvlaki shop no meats here from what i could tell i had the spinach span ako pita and the greek salad both were great the flaky buttery layers of dough crumble under your top fingers as you lift the span ako pita but the bottom stays dense in a deeply satisfying way unlike some span ako pits they use salt sparingly the feta does the work here alongside the spinach the salad contrasted with this nicely fresh tomatoes cucumbers feta oregano and a tapenade made it a greek salad as good as any ive had in great greek restaurants the olive oil based dressing is served on the side i skipped it as the span ako pita did the trick i also got to try their dips at the register served with a sort of sesame bagel which i assume is also greek the dips were phenomenal my favourite was the get ready for it me piano sabata a eggplant based dip with honey and walnut really enjoyed discovering this place will definitely be back|1
in the land of chinese food you truly never know what your e going to get in arizona so over the years when order chinese delivery i stick to the main stays we order delivery through beyond menu and after submitting the order the website populated with an estimated delivery time of 4050 minutes well 1 hour and 25 minutes later the food arrived the delivery driver took an additional 3 minutes verifying my credit card information that he had written down and then left annoyed i angry i made the very short trek to my kitchen to fix a plate everything was lukewarm at best while i dont expect steam i feel its a realistic expectation that barring getting food from a papa murphy type place that i shouldnt have to heat delivery food up the sesame chicken had all of the sauce on the bottom which left this weird mushy and chewy chicken nugget balls that lacked any real flavor the fried rice was completely absent of all of the things that make fried rice great onions peas egg or any type of protein the spring rolls aside from the fact that they were cold were so greasy and bland that even a fat kid would tap out in short in the land of phoenix lucky wok is not a good bet for chinese american cuisine|0

green care is the worst company we have ever dealt with nothing but frustration unfulfilled promises demands for surcharge beyond what was agreed in the contract delays and being consistently ignored by them we paid 79900 signed on april 4 2018 and were told it would take 34 months to complete we are at the ith month and did not pass the final inspection by clarke county because the fire pits were not installed there were multiple no shows lakes in the back yard due to cutting irrigation lines not leveling the gravel leaving a huge pile not moving the boulders dead plants everywhere which they said they would replace but didnt they wanted an extra 2500 and used this to abandon their contact they have totally abandoned and ignored the completion of the project get ready for penalty i from your hoa due to the bad attitude of this company very much regret hiring this company|0

customer service was good but it was pointless to get my screen fix because it didnt work well after i have problems with the buttons pressing or not pressing the correct one when i took it to go get fixed he basically said it was my fault because of a small crack even though it had been happening before that also the screens seem really weak ive only had mine for 10 days and the screen has already cracked when i had the original screen it lasted two years without any problems i paid 80 for the fix and it didnt even work properly he offered the price of 55 to fix his first mistake so basically he wants me to pay all over again for a faulty screen|0
the last time i went to silver star comics it was about a year ago i arrived at the store some time after noon and it was closed i thought the store closed down and left i later find out they are still in business so i try again i arrived at 1237pm used the other door and they were closed i saw the sign say its supposed to be open at 1200 am but the door is locked and the lights are off to me this showed they really dont care about their customers if they cant open up on time i could forgive them if it was 5 minutes life happens being late by over 45 minutes is not a good way to run a business if i cant trust them to open up on time i cant trust they will get the books i want and i certainly cant trust them to be open on time on new comic day never going back again|0

we left a car parked for a family member that was arriving from the airport we left a spare key inside the car upon picking up the passenger they asked how he was getting into the car the innocent passenger commented that a spare key was left in the car for him the shuttle driver called the office and in another language told the office of this they then proceeded to break into the car and take the key and lock the car when the traveler arrived at the car where we told him it was he found all doors locked the office staff came out and told him it would be 250 for a locksmith service to open the door he told them that was impossible because the car had been left unlocked for him with a key hidden inside when they pressed him to spend the money to unlock the car he told them someone in the family would just bring a spare key for him at this time they were all in the office and someone went out and opened the car and put the key back in here is the kicker that makes this ridiculous beyond belief after they broke into the car stole the key and tried to trick the driver into paying 250 to get the car unlocked when they gave up and decided to put the key back they put the key back in a different place and left different doors unlocked than what the family had instructed the driver these people break into cars left parked at their parking facility stay away|0
an awful experience dealing with adams pool so unions they started the job late even though the contact had a specific start date in it they finished it slowly dropped off equipment and did preliminary work on a thursday and then did not resume work until monday and they left the job incomplete they refused to hook up an auto fill feature on the pool even though i hired them to completely restore my pool that had all of its equipment ripped out and even though the contract said they were hired to rewire all equipment they claim that hooking up the equipment that keeps the pool filled was not within the contract i paid them more than ask i never asked them to lower their price hooking up the auto fill feature can not cost more than 300 and still these dirtbags refuse to do it as part of the contract you can call me a fool for hiring these guys somewhere on the web i read a review that included a similar experience to this i ignored that bad review because of some other good ones i read dont make the same mistake i did adams pool solutions is nothing but a pita to deal with|0
great coffee best service loving it i just need to fill out more words so im gonna keep typing but yea this place is good it gets busy bit i like it|1
great service without a doubt decent space though not particularly romantic some harsh lighting in spots ive eaten there twice and while the food is fine its not something id return for tonight i had a flatbread with goat cheese and eggplant and tomatoes i think it was fine but id suggest that it if it had been grilled served hot and may be with a lemony dressing as an example it would have been a much better experience similarly the kale salad was okay but the dressing was overly vinegary nothing wrong with a simple oil vinegar dressing but its also not something i go to a restaurant to experience overall very friendly respectful service with so so food|0
great place went here twice for their late night menu that begins at 10pm their blood pudding appetizer was so good doesnt sound good but it is soft tasty moist and not bloody also had their steak frites which was pretty good their french toast dessert was amazing|1
i miss the days when norton was our main guy at this place his service was exceptional and he went over board for his customers these days you get mediocre service twice i placed an order and no one called me to say the product was in i had to call after several weeks when i was told it would take a week or two i placed a special order and am now over five weeks beyond my order and i have come to the conclusion that mike didnt do his job immediately when you ask these guys something first of all it seems like you are bothering them and second its like they know everything and dont really care for their clients what was supposed to be a simple answer from their supplier for my order has become an ordeal for me this could have been clarified in one proper phone call unfortunately for me once my lighting issue will be resolved i will not be setting foot in this store again i am all for local small businesses but only if they have great personalized service and seem to really care oh and smile when they are happy to serve you sorry norton you have helped me out since 1993 and you were the best i have a business and if my staff dont reflect my values i dont think i could be in business i am heart broken to have to write this but i feel if i dont things may not change and if i do they also may not change we will see and by the looks of it there are many unhappy clients on yelp that have voiced their discontent it may be time for a staff meeting and go over what is really happening|0
wondering if the two pair deal is too good to be true it is i went in on a thursday afternoon two people were working and there was only one other customer in the store one employee greeted me and then returned to he desk to play on his cell phone i shopped for about a half hour trying on frames and finally left because no one would help me the moral of the story no one will help you if you are standing by the 79 frames|0
in less than 24 hours it was determined that they could not deliver the document within the time frame that i needed it delivered so i cancelled my order well good luck receiving a refund stay away there are plenty of businesses in this town that can provide the service you need this is ridiculous youve been warned|0
the walmart is a super centre so its quite large it has a garden centre as well as a grocery section so that it can be a one stop shop when it comes to necessities its kept pretty clean however like most walmart there never seems to be enough helpful staff they are often far and few between on the off chance that you may need help usually in the tech department|1

kathy jo is a super sweet awesome aesthetical her salon is down the hall from my moms eyelash salon and i know her pretty well because of that when i started having acne issues she was the first person i wanted to call she is super funny and personable and i really enjoy speaking with her we met to discuss what to do about the issue and made some plans for some facials to help get me to the right place she is very knowledgable and im super excited for my facial with her i trust her completely i will write again after a couple of facials for some more follow up info oh is something that is absolutely awesome about kathy jo is that she does late appointments and so she was able to schedule me in quickly without any issues most people in the beauty business cant do that for me because im so ridiculously busy as a full time student and part time employee for 2 different jobs i was very pleased with how easy scheduling was|1
i have gone to the store many times have had nothing but the best customer service the store is always clean and very well stocked with just about everything you would need or want they have a great selection of animals from snakes to scorpions to birds and so on this is one of my favorite exotic pet stores to visit i would recommend this store to anybody looking for a great place to go not just for animals and supplies but for education as well there is many other exotic pet stores in town i have not visited all of them but wild things is my favorite even if its to stop in and chat or purchase|1
i called for more info thanks to a cancellation i was able to get a consultation the same day marylou comes across as very knowledgeable and thorough she answered every question i had some of them twice initially i was a bit disappointed to find out a very expensive product i was using was the likely culprit in my breakouts thankfully marylou had some ideas of what to do instead i decided to go ahead and start with a chemical peel i actually found it kind of relaxing throughout the treatment she explained what she was doing made sure everything felt ok its great to have a place like this located in the same building as my office will definitely be back would recommend to others|1
run dont walk from this facility picture yourself here and you would pray someone would rescue you my dad is a fairly new patient less than 2 weeks and we are trying to move him already to somewhere else the it person took him to the lunch room to each his lunch and assured him he would be right back this turned into an hour and a half and he was stuck in a lunch room with no one in site finally after finding the it department to have someone come and take him back to his room they had a sign on their door be back at 100 am it was 115 and when we knocked they were happily dining on pizza with not a care in the world about the patient they had forgotten this really spells accountability and caring right today they left him in a sitting in a wheel chair for 4 hours he was scheduled for it at am and once again no one in site i have no idea why they are in business if this was a private company the doors would be shuttered this is funded by medicare and they have no reason to work hard because there are no consequences we like our doctor she is compassionate smart and caring however we only see her perhaps twice a week for a very short amount of time we understand she cares for many patients as for the staff there is a culture of un accountability and true caring for the patient i know why there ratings are so low unfortunately i was hoping it would be no true but trust me they deserve it|0
if i could leave arias zero stars i would arias recently landscaped my front and back which consisted of pulling weeds mowing and trimming bushes and trees in the quote jessie claimed weed spray was included in the price and she and her crew would come over the following day at noon the next day they showed up at 730 without a heads up phone call that was all fine until once they were finished i didnt get a knock on the door or anything letting me know they were done so i could inspect and make sure they did the job right they just drove off and didnt even leave a receipt on the door once i realized they were gone i inspected the yard and saw many weeds in the front yard and several out back in the gravel areas of my yard i figured they sprayed the weed killer so they should be gone within a couple of days a couple of days went by and they werent gone my husband gave jessie a call and told her the problem and she said shed be out to look at it that day thursday she never came by my husband called her again on friday and she said she wouldnt be able to come by until monday now my husband informed her wed be out of town and she said thats fine that shed do it while we were away we received a voicemail on tuesday that she came by and pulled the weeds but we need to spray when we returned from our trip yesterday we had her card with a note on the back saying we need to spray totally unprofessional why say we need to spray when it was originally quoted in your price why say you are going to pull all of the weeds yet when we return theyre just thriving just a bunch of crooks in my opinion and wouldnt recommend their services to anyone|0
rarely do i give anything or anyone 5 star reviews because i always figure there is room for improvement however just completed another round trip from madison to airport ord that was fantastic first trip was two years ago when my sisters and i took a vacation to my with flight out of me using app on transport to and from airport each and every driver has been extremely professional and concerned with our comfort their punctuality is unequaled no matter what the weather if you need a limo service app is the best|1
this restaurant markets itself as tibetan indian and its an interesting concept but in reality i found the food fairly bland and uninspiring we got the butter tofu a plate of mom os and a dal soup and none of the dishes really stood out the ingredients did not taste fresh and overall it did not feel worth the money perhaps we caught them on a bad night or the dishes we ordered werent their specialties but i for one was not impressed there is better tibetan and better indian food to be had in montreal|0
very rude people in the leasing office specially my esha choice the leasing consultant i was forced to break the lease because of their incompetence since i moved here i had a lot of problems with the loud neighbors and they never did anything about it this lady doesnt belong in this kind of position her attitude is always nasty and disrespectful and she never accepts a critical opinion this place is one of the worst places i ever lived very dirty and very noisy if you choose to sleep in a room upstairs it means you will hear every single car that is driving by or parking in one of the garages because the buildings were projected so bad and the windows and walls are so thin that it feels laterally living in a storage garage area the residents are mostly students young and loud with fast cars and loud music all the time if you choose to sleep in the room downstairs you will hear the old and very noisy ac units so loud that it wakes you up they allowed the residents to keep their garages area very filthy and trashy which is disgusting another big issue is the dogs poop everywhere so much that you have to pay attention where you put your feet when you walk when i first got there they took an dna test of my dog in order to keep track of who is not cleaning after their dogs is because there is poop everywhere its been 9 months since i asked them to clean my balcony from pigeons poop but guess what they never did the job properly they actually installed some spikes on top of the dirt i wasnt able to use my balcony for the entire stay because it was disgusting during the monsoon season last summer we had a very bad storm which it caused some damage of the roof tiles from august to october when i left the apartment the pieces of broken tiles were still on the floor in front of my door and the roof still to be repaired they claim that the community is marijuana free but unfortunately you can smell it at any corner and i witnessed many time exchanges of money and small bags by the gyrene gate which makes it very unsafe i would give this community may be 2 stars but not 5 for sure dont waist your money here there are cleaner quieter and cheaper communities around|0
my first time here and absolutely loved the way ziggy cut my hair the best haircut i ever had and definitely will be going back his staff is very friendly and welcoming|1
every single time i have come in the person at the counter has had a smile on their face they always take my order thoughtfully and make sure it is right i tell literally everyone i know to check out this place because the food is so tasty and fresh it is nice to have such an affordable option in the neighborhood the service is so friendly that it doesnt bother me that it takes a tad longer than i think it will the owner is always near managing the quality i can not recommend this place enough|1

great hotel but where was housekeeping stayed here for a girls trip saturday tuesday this was the and time some of the other girls had stayed here the rooms were nice and the beds were amazing the rooms are in different buildings around the property with private pools scattered about they offer golf cart service to take you and pick you up so you dont have to walk up the hills etc especially in heels at night we ate at elements ate at the bar ate at the pool and ordered room service and it was all wonderfully delicious we all got massages and were happy with those as well the main pool is nice but wear shoes as the ground is super hot we rented a cabana so we could have guaranteed shade pool was refreshing and drinks were good my complaint is that our room did not get cleaned on the first day we called that evening to ask why the manager called me back to apologize and asked what time they could clean it for us the next day i told her am would be a good time the next day the room did not get cleaned again so we called around up and asked them to come clean asap we were out of towels and needed to take showers and get ready for dinner why would the cleaning crew never come and especially again the next day after the manager said they would come at am there must be a lack of communication between the manager and the cleaning crew|1
my boyfriend and i were shopping here today when we were falsely accused of shoplifting i had tried on a bunch of dresses chose three that i wanted and walked over to wait outside the mens dressing room so my boyfriend could show me the jeans he was thinking of buying the loss prevention guard darren follows him in before my boyfriend gets to the door where i can see him the guard tells him to go back and change into his things and get out of the store my boyfriend responds do you work here im trying to show my girlfriend who is right outside the door my phone and wallet are still inside the dressing room im obviously not trying to walk out with these and leave my stuff he tells him he doesnt care and keeps repeating to my boyfriend that he needs to leave my boyfriend goes back and changes they both walk outside and see me standing there i ask what happened and the man tells me drop the clothes and get out im completely taken a back my boyfriend tells me hes been wrongly accused of stealing i ask if i can purchase the clothes i was waiting to buy and he repeats drop the clothes and get out he continues to follow us loudly saying get out and dont come back in front of the entire store it was very very embarrassing he was extremely rude the entire time not listening to either of us not letting us talk to a manager and obviously not trying to follow any logic or obvious characteristics of shop lifters aside from racial stereotypes and bias considering my boyfriend is darker skinned with long hair why would my boyfriend run out of the store with 10 jeans and leave his entire wallet i id cash cards and even a gift card for arlington coat factory i called the manager from outside the store and reported these grievances as to not cause a further scene i asked him to check the cameras he just said okay ill tell the do bye no apology or ounce of humanity i regret not standing my ground inside the store then potentially the police wouldve been called and gone over the facts footage logic like an intelligent human being wouldve done not like some bored storefront security guard who seems to be waiting to pounce on any person he subjectively deems suspicious based on his own bias instead of fact it is very dangerous to have a store security guard who maintains this kind of mindset to sum it up i know theres not much to be done here aside from contacting corporate so i wanted to write a review letting the community know this place felt highly unsafe and i have never been treated with such disrespect they had good clothes at decent prices if you dont mind running the risk of being falsely accused treated as less than human and embarrassed in front of an entire store personally i refuse to give my money to a company that supports this and hope you will too|0
beware do not use moving masters unless you want your items broken horrible experience i hired this moving company thinking i was hiring experienced movers but i didnt expect to see movers throw peoples belongings around and slide things on hard floors without having some sort of mat in place they chipped stained and scratched my brand new crate barrel bed frame and my new leather sofa they also broke my long mirror and lost the plastic pegs for my glass coffee table what gets me even more furious is that the co manager tells me this is the type of service i get for the money i paid because other moving companies charge more than 80 an hour plus he told me that they were tired from working 9 days straight if that were the case i would have rescheduled for another day or hired a professional moving company that could handle a simple one bedroom move seriously disappointed with this company|0

i made an appointment online for this location i received a phone message from anna to call back and confirm my appointment i called and they had no record of anna or my appointment they were more concerned with what type of insurance i had than making my appointment i was practically accused of being crazy and calling the wrong store customer service is nonexistent at this store if this is how they treat people before they become patients i dont want to become one unbelievably rude women now i am calling nationwide vision corporate office to vent oh and i am going to barnet delaney perkins eye center|0
they deserve zero stars people here are fucking lazy i dont know why management hires people with such poor attitudes every time there is something wrong with my food cold soggy wings my pizza looks like it got cut by a toddler just people here in general suck they treat you as if they are doing you a favor even though its their job they should just let everyone go and hire people with positive attitudes and bring in new management i placed an order at 935 am on saturday this store is supposed to close at 1100 am i get there and its closed all i see is the lazy staff going home early they didnt even bother to call me to let me know its was closed so i just spent my time for nothing i hope the owner of this franchise or someone from corporate read this please do something about the shitty customers service you have and stop hiring lazy fucks i just cant get over how lazy these people are its happened more than once anyone here save your time and money go to a different store|0
i needed a new mattress so i headed over because i saw a sign advertising a sale on queen sized mattresses im on a budget so this sounded like a great plan i went in and the salesperson was helpful and not at all pushy i tried out the inexpensive model and it felt pretty good in the store so i bought it i was in and out in about 20 minutes delivery was scheduled for a window between 9 and noon a few days later when i bought the mattress i was told that i had 100 days to try it out and that if i didnt like it i could return it and would get a refund minus a 150 restocking fee the delivery drivers came right at the beginning of the delivery window and were done in just a few minutes they were polite and professional unfortunately mattresses arent always as good in real life as they are in the mattress store after a few weeks i decided that i didnt really like the mattress i went back to the store to arrange for a return since the mattress was really inexpensive to begin with i would have only gotten a few dollars back after the restocking fee the salesperson worked with me and was able to discount the restocking fee so that i still got back about half of what i paid the delivery drivers came the next morning once again at the beginning of the pickup window and hauled the mattress away even though i ended up not liking the mattress the entire process was hassle free and i feel that i was treated like a valued customer|1
the price seems a bit high but worth to try out at least once they chatted with me even vacuumed the loose ends awsome then used a blade to trim then they insisted on the advertised price of 21 and no tip however i liked the services at that point i tipped i would go again|1
this guy has no bedside manner and is rather unfriendly his practice is an unorganized mess i had to make over 10 phone calls to get a procedure scheduled then they didnt send me the paperwork then they called in the wrong prep re to the pharmacy all so this cranky doctor can look down my throat or up my ass will be finding someone else next time|0

would not recommend at all we were in a car accident and needed intimidate help for our back problems i was scheduled to come in but upon arriving and spending several hours there they told me to come back not the next day but weeks later because the doctor was going on vacation seriously i cant wait weeks to see a chiropractor after an accident their equipment and practices are also extremely out dated compared to other chiropractors in the area their billing is terrible and feels like a scam i went to another chiropractic and got in that day and was taken care of right away id highly suggest looking around the area for other services especially if you need more than one treatment|0
the staff is friendly they have great hours coupons galore even for returning customers a drive up window and fast service|1
yogurt ini is the best because of its toppings and tasty yogurt the staff is nice and the environment is great ask for teresa|1
never one to rate based on a solo experience unless traveling but yogurt i me yogurt me has now provided 6 separate disappointing experiences the first poor experience was one of poor service the employee was on a personal phone call the entire time we were there barely managing to even communicate the total of our transaction the second was that the business closed two hours earlier than their posted time with just a sign that said closed on the door both of these were on offs or so i thought the third time was again one of poor service where the employees were too engaged in dialogue with one another to engage with us at all we had several acceptable goes after those so we decided to keep trying fourth disappointing experience was that i looked up their hours online and arrived an hour and twelve minutes before their posted closing time to find them already closed fifth pretty much a repeat but by 30 minutes the sixth and last poor experience was tonight and inspiring enough for me to finally sever any desire to patronize establishment again i arrived 25 minutes before closing no caramel sauce no cookie dough and no credit card machine i do not carry cash i suggested assuming after 1213 visits in under 6 months that i could pop by tomorrow and pay the cashier who phoned her boss after being on the phone with him making her try to run my card over and over for roughly 10 minutes said we can put it in the freezer if you want to come back and pay for it um yeah no by this time it is also less than ten minutes til close now had there been a sign on door to advise of this id have may be been open to driving ten minutes since it i have been my bad but since there wasnt and since wed both already put our fingers or spoons in the fro yo i was more insulted than anything hope 15 in in fro yo which id have happy paid for tomorrow when i come to sumo next door to eat their delicious sushi as i do every friday that you cant possibly resell was worth losing usually pretty for giving customers over|0

do not go to this nail salon i have been to other regal nails and they have been fine good prices so so atmosphere but worth it for a pretty good pedicure at a good price 1999 however this particular regal nails was awful from the beginning when i went to the desk the woman the older of the 2 women working that day was the one who was available she took me to the chair and when i put my feet in the water was really hot dont get me wrong i love hot showers hot tubs etc but this nearly burned my feet she then made small talk while doing my pedicure which really hurt she was rough and didnt seem to care when i repeatedly winced in pain she was chatting with the other woman who also worked there and was giving someone else a pedicure next to me most of the time and often just stopped what she was doing with me in order to look at the women and finish her conversation at least 57 times often while holding my foot in the air during the massage it was very annoying when she was done i wanted to sit for a few minutes to let the polish dry and she nearly threw me out even though no one was waiting she came over and grabbed my purse and started looking for my wallet to return my card i took the card from her and told her i would do it she then grabbed my legs and began rolling down my jeans to which i again told her i could do it she grabbed my purse and drink and sandals and tried to shove them on my feet i grabbed my stuff and left i was in such a rush to get out of there that i didnt even notice what a shoddy job she had done i still had some of my old polish on the sides and she had gotten polish on my feet not that this would excuse this behavior but it was the middle of the day not even close to closing and as i said no one was waiting i will never return to this salon again and hope they improve their service if they hope to remain in business|0
the worst movers ever i paid for 3 guys since the the moving company assured me it would be cheaper in the long run because things would be so much faster they arrived and had me sign paperwork and got started the one guy i heard later was sick and stayed in the truck arranging things and never came inside to see how the guys were doing i found out later that they had hired the guys that day and had never checked out their references when they moved my nearly new refrigerator they forced it thru the gate and scratches were left on the front from the stucco of the pony wall on the patio movers are suppose to open the doors and ease it around but these guys knew nothing of how a mover does things i spoke with the office manager and she said it wasnt their fault that the guys presented references and they just didnt have time to check them out i told them it was most certainly their fault since i hired a professional moving company i had expected professional movers she said there was nothing she could do and i told her id call everyday until i was able to speak with the owner after a half dozen phone calls at least the office manager said she had spoken with the manager and he had agreed to fix the door to the refrain or replace it if necessary i had two guys come out to look at the repairs and it was determined that the door would need to be replaced i supplied all of the mug information so they could order the doors three months later i called and asked about the doors they acted like they knew nothing about them when they finally remembered they said the doors had arrived and the installation guy david would be calling me to arrange installation david called within the week i told him the refrigerator was in storage but id meet him there so he could swap out the door well we were scheduled to meet and david never showed up i called him at least 40 times and he did not answer his cell phone i complained to the office and they said that david still worked for them and they i let him know more and more attempts were made over the next 3 months and my calls went unanswered nearly 9 months later i moved to ca brought the refrigerator that was horribly damaged i called again and the office said they i have david bring the door in and i could either pick it up or have it shipped to ca needless to say they never called and have never made any attempt to resolve this problem i am so unhappy with the experience do not use these guys a couple of hundred more and you can get an experienced mover like warrens or even the haul helpers have been better than my experience with cheep cheep movers|0
i had a chipped tooth bonded today by do kelly he was very up front with what was needed suggested minor work on the bottom tooth so it would not interfere with the bonded tooth when the upper and lower met pricing was very fair he did not try to up sell me which is very common in the dental business he was very polite personable and professional keep in mind he was very busy pam at the front desk was great i spoke with her yesterday when i called the office some of the other dentists cosmetic i called wanted to xray one tooth and would not give me an idea what the bonding would cost until i was seen would not provide a range i appreciated the way pam handled everything on the phone the day before and thats why i made the appointment for this morning great customer service thank you do kelly|1

this is the absolute best place to get your alignment or brake work done i just had my lifted 92 jeep done and it is driving like new now i have brought all of my vehicles ive owned over the last 10 years into georges and have never been disappointed dont be discouraged by the appointments only thing as they have plenty of openings for alignment and brake work in this down economy i verified that today with the office manager bobby y mentions that they dont have the fancy computers to check the alignments ive never seen any computers there while i was waiting for work to be done but then again i have never had an issue to be concerned about it i have had lots of issues left over by shops that have all of the digital equipment thats the whole reason i had to bring my 92 jeep to georges alignment brake service in the first place the jeep had been previously totaled with extensive frame damage they fixed the frame but botched the alignment after about 40 minutes on my jeep and a quick test drive it was given their seal of approval thats good enough for me knowing their work and sure enough it is driving like new again thanks again georges alignment and brake service you get an a in my book|1
if you ever want to be ripped off and mislead this is the shop for you i went with this shop even with reading the other reviews because patrick seemed very knowledgeable however after giving them 4000 dollars im still left with a vehicle thats not running and in my opinion not much better than it got sent to them the quote was to finish a is conversion in an so where the motor and trans were sitting on the chassis i sent it off nov and was told to expect to be done late dec january after numerous calls starting middle of january getting told they would have it dont soon and every time being told it was coming together i began getting cynical about this ordeal well february comes around and i received a call from dan with the news that its now going to be an additional 1500 dollars to finish this project due to the engine not being mounted when it arrived and now it hits the cross member that 1500 was mostly labor on taking it back apart and reassemble the entire front clipped i fail to see how a shop could have reassembled the truck without first starting the vehicle to see if it ran and then wanting me to pay redo it twice on their negligence i refused to pay and told them to return my truck upon inspection of my truck i have found a great number of issues with their craftsmanship and work first none of the fuel lines were fabricated or installed pedal and wiring werent installed none of the accessories were connected to harness radiator no supported in radiator sup pro it and the biggest issue they cut into my frame with an oxy torch without prior approval which from the looks of the cut really scare me as to the quality of their work i have filed a bob report and will never use recommend or consider this shop again|0
fast efficient and reliable would definitely recommend and plan to use them again in the future|1
i had a friend recommend the show to me and i loved it this felt like classic vegas i highly recommend this show to anyone just wanting to see a group of really talented guys put on a really good show the 4 guys are all really different from one another and put together a great blend of comedy magic that keeps you guessing whats going to happen next they pulled a lot of people up from the audience and brought the whole crowd into the show theyre all serious veterans of the stage and each have their own schtick that works well separately as well as together i would 100 see it again|1

well i must say i read the first persons review of this place and i have to agree with him i donated back in 2008 and his description of the place was not far from the truth at all however i moved away in 2009 and just recently came back to the charlotte area in late 2010 i needed a little extra cash so i went back now it is all electronic you walk in and dont even have to talk with a person if you do not want to but you still have the option to and walk over to the machines very noticeable and fill out the small questionnaire and wait about 20 minutes then you are called back to be medically examined to make sure you are fit for the donation then called back in about 510 minutes after that the donation process takes about an hour to an hour and a half depending on the person first time donors or return donors that have been gone for more than a year pay for you will start at 5000 dollars a visit you are allowed to donate twice a week and then 4500 and 2500 rotating after that its not bad if you need the extra cash and have the time to spare it is worth your time a lot better than 2008 and i would recommend that you give it another try|1
the worst korean bar ever you have been warned i have been coming to this bar for last 10 years before the change of new management but i would never go there again nor bring any of friends the new owner is terribly rude and draft beer tastes suck the food is also considered not edible the color of their cooking oil is darker than your engine oil|0

first i want to preface with sam the plumber was very professional and seemed to care about his work it is very unfortunate that he was thrown into a job he did not start we have had jenni plumbing fix two diff things in our house and both have resulted in leaks shortly after turns out the guy who started both of these jobs was actually fired very coincidental right well this last job was a pretty big deal considering we were supposed to close on our house in 4 days and then after the job was fixed there was a leak that went through our ceiling down stairs the leak was not cause directly by the repair but there was some questionable piping that was not diagnosed nor were we informed about this in my book is negligence now if they would have just apologized and offered to pay for repairs i would have completely understood since i know we are all human and miss things but not taking responsibility is what upset me when i called the manager which by the way waited all day for call back that i never got ron didnt seem to want to listen or really care about what had happened he mentioned he did not have time and asked what exactly i wanted this to me is not great customer service truly i would have liked not only a refund on the service but how about repairing my walls anyway i would not recommend this plumber because in the end mistakes happen but it is how you handle fixing these mistakes and making it right for the customer that matters im not one who usually leaves reviews but i felt this experience warranted it thank you to sam the plumber who was so gracious in handling this mess the best he could kudos to you unfortunately you dont have the backing of your company and that is truly a shame|0
i love this place this has to be the most welcoming and cool record shop ive ever been to the guys that work here are super nice and really know their stuff they have a decent selection of music but i go mostly to get tickets for shows they sell the tickets for less than any other place in the city not charging any fees a place you definitely have to check out in montreal|1
i went to this place on a whim i had high expectations when i saw the menu unfortunately that lasted as long as it took to get our food i ordered the hot in cleveland sandwich it came dry and tasteless my girlfriend got the chicken parm sandwich the chicken was over cooked and the cheese wasnt all the way melted how is that possible we talked to the sous chef who was the acting manager he told me this place is owned by the people that own the boneyard that place was a disaster and now i understand why this place was so bad stay away your e better off going to get a big mac these owners do not care about their restaurants may be after this one fails they can put another failure in the boneyard building|0
i am extremely dissatisfied with pinnacle perinatal i care and will not use them in the future would not recommend the ultrasound techs are great but their office employees and managers are very unhelpful and un accommodating when using insurance check if theyre cash paying price is cheaper they were going to charge my sister 275 for an ultrasound using her insurance and didnt tell her if she paid cash it would only be 75 they do not have the patients best interest in mind i have nontraditional insurance myself and they have not be able to provide me with a simple itemized bill for the services i paid for i am dumbfounded by this offices lack of customer service i do not recommend|0
what a terrible experience dealing with this company was they are very helpful up front and review everything however they mislead you and once their work is done will not return calls or answer the phone my appraisal came back at the price that the terms were negotiated and ref denied when called to inquire my once helpful agent who always answered the phone will not pick up the phone plus they unethically changed themselves to my lender through my insurance company and even provided a loan number despite the loan not being approved oh and not to mention charges through my bank for requests made on their part i would not recommend this company to anyone|0
such a great customer service experience i didnt know that there was another option to the big box pharmacies they take insurance the same way but i didnt feel like a number its like a small town get to know you pharmacy i love the way it looks too very warm and relaxing a place you enjoy waiting for your order|1
this place is great because of location in my opinion but for the prices they ask i really dont know if it is worth while my lease is up in a few months and i would like to stay but only if i get a fair price for my place they tried to hike up my rent for a renewal after i found out someone with the exact same unit is paying 300 dollars less than me the only way i would stay is if they gave me a fair price as for the complex the tiles in the kitchen break the cabinets are cheap the appliances are dated and the dish washer does not work well for the same price they are asking you can find something better one of the worst drawbacks is that every entrance smells like dog urine and there is always something broken you can expect that once a week you will get an email saying that a certain door is broken or the elevator is not working wrap up the place is falling apart and for the same price you can find something a lot nicer|0
horrible horrible horrible they sell animals plain and simple people should be adopting animals from shelters and not contributing to the commercialization of buying and selling animals for profit cats and dogs are being euthanized daily in shelters due to overpopulation and we have stores like this one who are selling for profit not to say that the food selection isnt great or the prices arent competitive but its an ethical issue and its sad that this store has no eith is if they did they would be working with shelters to adopt out animals and not selling them as if they are merchandise|0

i will never go here again and suggest you do the same six months ago i brought my car in for an oil change and to check out a vibration in my car whenever i drove it over 55 mah goodyear charged me 600 when all was said and done and when i drove the car away it still was vibrating when i brought the car back to goodyear to complain they told me there was nothing they could do because they had not actually fixed the problem it was a bent rim that was the cause of the vibration and that would be an additional 500 i learned my lesson and moved on however a couple of weeks ago i was driving in cleveland and hit a pothole surprise i decided that the flat tire was reason to go to goodyear again and give them a second chance because i had bought road damage insurance with my tires biggest bait and switch tactic ever i brought my car into the shop and after about a 15 minute hassle from the manager tom pleasant fellow let me tell you he finally relented to uphold the road damage insurance i had indeed bought and give me the tire for 30 much to my surprise i coincidentally ended up finding a screw in another tire the day after of course this one was not covered and they wanted to charge me 330 while i cant prove the source of the screw this in combination with paying 600 to not have my problem fixed is enough to lead me elsewhere if you have tons of money and nothing to do and like wasting 4 hours while your oil is changed by all means go here i will be taking my business elsewhere and i have filed a claim with the bob for their fraudulent tactics|0

we had some water damage from a roof leak in our home and once the roof issue was resolved we needed the drywall repaired i own several rental homes and have other contractors i could have called but because this was for our home which is on the higher end of the price range i wanted to use a licensed contractor to perform the work enter sundance drywall and the mess that it became the initial estimate process was fine and the estimated seemed good enough their bid seemed reasonable so without questioning it i approved it and they scheduled the work then it got wierd the worker showed up and was very old at least 70 i would say that would have been fine but he just mumbled and my wife could not understand him at all worst of all he literally smelled so bad of body odor that we literally could not go on that end of the house while he was there he worked all day and then mumbled something and left he then showed up unannounced the next day and just walked in no knock or anything just walked in through the garage while my wife and kids were there alone that day my wife just left primarily due to the smell all of that would have been forgiven if the work was good but unfortunately it was not the texture they sprayed has now flaked off in several places just a few weeks later he sprayed texture all over the recessed can lights and i am in the process of replacing one the rest of the workmanship was poor and we are considering having it all redone rather than look at the garbage that they installed they were aggressive in collecting payment though and when i asked to speak with someone about the way they left the house and the poor quality of the job they basically said it was the best they could do and then told me i had to pay the full price or they would file for a lien i am using yelp more and more to vet contractors as it seems there are more bad than good here in the valley of the sun and i know i would have wanted to know the truth about these guys before choosing them to do the work they were given every opportunity to make it right but chose not to stay away from sundance and choose another contractor for your job|0
at first he seem like a good guy when i came in for an estimate to fix my car he told me that he only work alone so he get to my car until two weeks later but it will cost about 140 for an estimate about two weeks and a half he called me with an estimate of over 5000 to fix my car no problem i say ill get back to you 5 days later i came in ready to pay half so that he can start working on my car but he told me that he working on two different cars and probably will get on my in a week or so so he ask me why the rush i told him that im traveling then dude went all loud on me telling me that i can take my car somewhere els if i can wait then precede to say that he will charge storage for 900 plus the estimate fee i told him that he cant do that otherwise we will be seeing each other in court then he say he will call the police lol i told him to call the police then then he turned around and ask me to give him 200 and we will be over with so i give him my debit card and then he turned around and say that he only take cash and check so i went home got my check book but this time i came with dispatch for witness purposes when we arrive the change hes mind by saying that he only take cash and will not accepted check so i end up going to the atm to get his 200 horrible experience and will never go back|0
horrible experience here this evening unfortunately as we live in the neighborhood and would have gone here more in the future when we asked for no cheese due to a dairy allergy they still placed it on the bread when my husband stated we didnt want cheese on that sub the young man scoffed took the cheese off and continued to use the same sandwich bread my husband asked nicely if he could use new bread as to avoid cross contamination and the young man was extremely rude about it and hesitated to do this with allergies not being taken seriously it makes it a restaurant we can not safely eat at and that is very unfortunate i would have expected better service especially when a place is just opening up and needing to gain patrons|0
about a month and a half ago we were visiting family in cleveland when we noticed our sweet boy bruce our precious shepherd retriever mix was irritated by his ear he was itching it was inflamed as well as warm to the touch historically he has been through many ear infections before this due to suffering severe allergies so we had an idea of what was going on we go to a holistic approached integrate vet in charlotte no where we currently live we gave them a call and got some ideas for holistic treatment for in home but were advised to go to the vet locally if it did not improve in about a day since i am writing this review it obviously did not improve with in home holistic approaches this time so i researched for vets in cleveland and to my absolute joy shaker square came up and i read it was an integrate medicine vet yes perfection i was so excited not to mention it is is only a few blocks down from where our family lives all communication with the staff was seamless and they made obtaining records and information from bruces current vet smooth as can be they were friendly efficient and as concerned about our i dogs comfort as we were so an appoint was easily made we arrived for our appointment time to a clean environment with a good smell you know some vets do not accomplish this with two ladies welcoming us at the front desk there is coffee and tea for your enjoyment and plentiful seating to wait until the appointments start my pup is pretty comfortable in new environments but you can tell when he is really at ease and he was just like he is at his home vet do kim is amazing i have to brag a lot here i mean he makes his own treats for the pups here both dried and frozen he is brilliant do kim is an honest example of holistic and mindful he is efficient in his work and deductive reasoning he communicates his thoughts and treatment plans and he is patient to answer any and all questions he gave love and attention to bruce and was patient when bruce though listening to heart tones was play time he thinks everything is a game honestly he swabbed is ear and ran thorough testing indeed bruce did have an ear infection and a fairly severe one at that bruce had a lot going on in his ear and we all agreed medicine was the best way to go bruce was given an ear cleanser and medication he used his again homemade by his own hands frozen slurp ie to distract bruce as he showed us the best way to clean and medicate the ear due to i being very irritated when someone gets close to his ears it worked like a charm and he sent the frozen slurp ie home with us to use when we treated in home i could go on and on but 100 come here do kim is amazing the environment is great and i am so grateful to have a place to be comfortable going when visiting cleveland which we do often and bruce 99 of the time travels with us i trust them here like i trust our home vet and that says a lot bruce is our 1 and we never go anywhere for him without initially vetting thoroughly so come here for your vet needs both traditional and holistic aka treatment and preventative|1

did everything they could to make my 15 hour move last 2 hours and 5 minutes so that they could charge me for that extra hour unfortunately i did not say anything during the move my mistake however at the very end they wanted a 4 hour minimum even though i was told it was a 2 hour minimum over the phone when i was booking i was moving from a bedroom in a house with roommates into a condo the loading took 45 minutes although 6 months before with a different company the loading barely 20 minutes with exactly the same stuff then the 20 minute drive to the new place somehow turned into another 45 minute ordeal then when unloading they brought everything box by box instead of using the dolly and went 5 minutes over the 2 hour minimum eventually i paid the 2 hour minimum 55 dollars for that extra 5 minutes on top of everything they were late in the beginning and wanted to charge me by the booking time and not the time they arrived|0

just went to this place for the first time recently for brunch i know where have i been but i saw that they had a bloody mary bar so i decided to try it the food and bloody marys were fantastic and the food was great i tried the eggs benedict and the fruity pebble pancakes and they were excellent the fruity pebble pancakes were so good i had to force myself to stop eating them because they are massive i surely will be going back|1

i gave le peep 4 stars because they have great smoothies this is one of 2 breakfast places i frequent on the weekends they have been going through some tough times lately because of the light rail construction so busy times are hit or miss generally around brunch time on the weekends its not too bad but every once in a while you will hit them at their busy time generally i get really good service at le peep lately however it has been slow bad or not at all i used to see the owner there working every time i went in but havent seen her in several months so i dont know if it was sold to someone else or what after i stopped seeing her there is when i started seeing the servers come and go and the service get worse i find the breakfast food pretty good and like i said the smoothies are great i have not had anything for lunch there i can recommend the french toast or the mini veggie omelet which is awesome they have pretty good coffee and their prices are reasonable to top it all off they give you punch cards good toward free meals le peep seems to be going through some tough times right now but im sticking with them for my weekend breakfast and i recommend them to anyone in the central phoenix area looking for something better than your other choice ihop|1

have eaten here before and been relatively happy with things but tonight ordered the chicken risotto and got a soupy drippy soggy mess ate a bit of it because i was famished and didnt want to wait 20 min for another risotto while my of was finishing her meal and expected a visit from the manager and or to have it removed from my bill but alas we were offered and respectfully declined free dessert and were charged full pop for everything else oh and no manager visit whatsoever i expect better customer service for a downtown restaurant|0

i stopped in here to buy a product for my mom that she had mentioned recently as we were going through a duty free store in an airport the service level of the sales associate melanie was top notch as she helped me locate the exact item i was in search of i was impressed by the entire line of products and their commitment to provide cruelty free and organic skincare products i think i may have to start treating myself to this luxurious store more often the reviews of all of their products on senhora nordstroms and other websites speak volumes especially about the immortally brand before leaving i was signed up for their customer loyalty program and my only regret was not stumbling into this little gem of a store sooner|1
some misguided go to church to socialize gossip or create divisiveness others such as myself go because they hunger for the gospel i attended the cove many times and enjoyed most aspects some friendly people and good worship music mostly impersonal congregation but i thoroughly enjoyed the sermons and the main pastor i assume mike until the fateful day i ran across this man of god outside on a walkway to say i was disappointed is leaving it short this wonderful compassionate man of god or so i thought when i asked for prayer after telling him i enjoyed his sermons informed me i was sick and needed help in a very critical mean spirited way only because i honor the house of the lord did i refrain from cussing him out perhaps this particular pastor preacher or great man of god in his own mind can use some lessons in humility and how to actually be christine i suffer debilitating pain around the clock from severe spinal problems the same as thousands do who didnt ever ask for it or expect it i unfortunately am prescribed major pain meds which i detest and despise but from excruciating pain am left to deal with daily so for this supposed man of god to show contempt and disrespect to someone suffering in pain to address me and tell me im sick and need help in such a hateful manner well i feel he needs a sincere christian leader to teach him lessons in humility and compassion for others less fortunate the same as jesus christ would have its one thing to have other church members sit in judgment of others when they have zero clue the walk another person walks many love to sit in judgment and gossip but for the lead pastor of a church this size or for that matter any size to be have in such a disgusting manner is a prime example of a pastor running people away from churches and the home of christ where people hunger for the word pastor mike is well schooled in talking the talk just short of walking the walk a real christian leads by example and not by words i havent returned pastor mike so great job of demonstrating what a hypocrite is such a shame in a church of many sincere hearts to represent a church that sends out invitations all over the area to attend in this manner i take solace in the knowledge we all will answer including you pastor we all even you fall short and i forgive you but look deep inside your soul if you are representing christ as the leader of his church|0

probably the worst customer service i have ever received they had to come out twice to set up direct to and charged 95 each time when the second time they clearly could have told me it was an issue with my account and to simply call direct to instead they send a tech out and charge me 95 for a five minute phone call i could have made myself avoid multi com it is a scam|0
its a good option for college for some people offers all the academic options support of the asu system in a smaller campus thats easy to access if you live in the east valley its a vibe similar to what id think a small liberal arts college would have there are an increasing number of amenities including brand new dorms dining and fitness center on campus the area itself is growing and essentially safe but boring suburbs if you want to hit mill avenue frequently or want to be close to college sporting events go to tempe if you want smaller classes and a more intimate college setting where your professors will all know your name polytech is a good option|1

i just stopped by to grab an espresso after being recommended this location by a friend of mine i cued up in the line and began to enthusiastically ask where the coffee was sourced from to which im assuming the owner quickly rattled off somewhere in north toronto to which i asked more specifically if he had a name seeming annoyed at my inquiry he said does it matter i was so dumbfounded i politely thanked the attendant and left the store to answer your question marvel coffee it does matter to me who is roasting your coffee and where you are sourcing it next time my owner if you are so bothered by my enthusiastic questions i suggest relocating yourself to the back of your location for if it had not been for you i would have still purchased a coffee from your very polite barista even if she didnt have the answer to my question cheers restaurant manager and enthusiastic coffee drinker|0
bought a and hand 20 mountain bike for five bucks from someone on craigslist a couple weeks ago it actually wasnt in horrible condition but regardless i planned to have it looked at tweaked greased etc before releasing the six year old on it i honestly didnt know that build a bike was in surprise and was planning to arrange a service at performance bike on thunderbird but the wife pointed out that there was a bike shop that shed seen from the road behind kohl at the time they werent showing on yelp so i submitted the business entry and voila here i am with the first review took the bike in today and boy what a great experience tyler greeted me as soon as i walked in and immediately took my bike to a service area in the corner while i waited and chatted with him he fitted a new colored chain a bell grips and replaced the rusty old kickstand service was done in no more than 20 mins and for a cost well under what i was expecting i normally give three stars for places i like and very rarely give four this place gets five friendly efficient the store is clean and they look to have a good selection of bikes and parts and extremely reasonably priced for service i literally cant think of anything else that id expect from a bike store well worth anyones business|1
this place was very nice in my opinion my fiancee and i stayed in 325 which was very clean and organized there were little things which were sort of laughable but not a grievance such as this being a room with a king size bed for two but only having one set of shampoo and conditioner and the television is a nice wide led screen hooked up with the typical i connector bac cable which ancient tis used probably due to distribution limitations of cable to over an entire hotel and this results in a poor quality picture the real problem issues were there being no secondary liner behind the shower curtain causing the water to spill onto the floor easily and this is dangerous because the tub is not sunk into the floor a few inches as it would be in a residential home so its a big step down which threw me off and almost caused me to slip and the water pressure was really low which does not result in a satisfying shower experience my fiancee and her long hair really werent happy about this but i really loved this hotel it was pleasant to stay in the pool was great and the staff were super friendly and accommodating more shampoo and conditioner please i need the internet access code please the continental breakfast was pretty good you can make your own waffles which are tasty on actual waffle irons unfortunately the eggs are pretty salty perhaps they are powdered eggs but the sausage patties are good the fruit bowl and bagels are good i would recommend this place|1
food was ok but for fast food style greek food its too expensive i miss the old my greek restaurant it was full service and was the same price|0

my son has been going there for about 18 months on a part time basis from about age 1 to 2 12 we do not have to put him in day care we are fortunate to have a family member care for our son we enrolled him in triple i for his social development he recently moved up in age class from room 104 to 105 two and three year olds there were concerns with the new teacher she is rigidly structured without having a loving demeanor my son loves his fire truck which is his comfort this is consistently removed from him in class the teacher stated that he needs to develop independence at 27 months old i do not believe comfort should be removed from a child the administrators of the facility stated he needs to attend class more often to develop trust for the teachers and facility my sons grandmother was happy to sit in on a class to ease my sons anxiety she was allowed in for one day during that time she saw the girls directed to play on one side of the classroom while the boys were prepared for potty time their diapers were removed their pants shorts pulled to their ankles and they were lined up at the bathroom front to back while the teacher tried to get each one to use the toilet and or have their diapers changed as a mother i found this method degrading and unnecessary we have not begun potty training at home as we feel our son is not quite ready triple i did not inform us that they would be doing this on the playground this same teacher forcefully directed a child to a time out seat and with her finger in face scolding a child for being disrespectful to a teacher the child looked to be about my sons age it appears they have hired a bully for a teacher we have removed our son from this facility|0

so heres my story with giant eagle on the southside this has always been the main giant eagle that we shopped at when i was younger back in those days where i didnt have a license back in the day i hated it absolutely hated it the parking lot was dangerous with drivers not looking out for pedestrians the atmosphere inside wasnt inviting and it felt like a complete chore to go shopping but today as i stopped in ive been away for some time i see that they have made some major changes the first are the prices lol you thought i was going to talk about the layout the additions nope lets start with the prices im currently in the northern va do area these prices at this giant eagle are more expensive than the ones in do i kid you not for example the salad bar is 799lb are you serious for salad i would expect to pay that in do not here getting back to the layout like another y el per indicated the pharmacy has moved over by citizens bank instead of being very close to the entrance i suppose that space is better giving them control of long lines if that still happens they now have a larger hot foods section with a cafe and i believe they sell alcohol at this location see my review of the giant eagle marketplace in shadyside im sure they all run them the same way and i feel like i need to address some that had issues with the clientele at that location honestly i feel like the y el per that addressed this previously was being over dramatic ive had some run ins with people who think the grocery store is a playground and let their kids run wild but ive seen the same thing at walmart if there is a huge problem request to speak to the manager or you have your choice to drive to another store alvis is right down the street|0

two seasons ago i took my snow blower in because my electronic start stopped working once they got it in they told me the carburetor had to be replaced i told them to go ahead got my snow blower back and it still didnt work sent it back and they replaced the starter no problem last winter my snowblower started leaking gas took it to another place and now they tell me the carburetor needs to be replaced its all junked up inside which leads me to wonder if the original carburetor was replaced in the first place just seems weird when its only been used may be 15 times since the replacement at the time i suspected all was not right trust your instincts i believe all along all i needed was a starter and they didnt replace the carburetor but i was charged for it never did the post because i figured i would just go elsewhere but now when im shown a gunk ed up carburetor things added up|0

been to several moxie i locations this one is standard with the others but one thing that put them above and beyond the manager and waitress ensured that those in my party who were lactose intolerant knew the entree ingredients beforehand they repeatedly came to the table to assure us of which food items to steer clear of due to their allergies excellent customer service and everyone did enjoy their food red curry chicken was good could have used a bit more chicken however burgers were good and plenty turkey club was dry but allergy to mayo would have left that out all else was good|1
if you like midcentury modern architecture or old school vegas history this is an amazing tour the house was the home of the orchestra leader at the sands back in the day it was on the di golf course and was moved downtown they have a video of the move which is interesting to see the house is classic midcentury modern but with some vegas twists especially since antonio morelli entertained at the house the furniture and furnishings are all true to the period and they also have clothes from that time it is like stepping back into the 50s60s they have done an outstanding job of restoring the house on our tour we had someone that worked with antonio morelli and a copa girl it was great to have two people that worked at the sands back then on the tour with us the junior league does an awesome job with the tour and explaining the the history and architecture and the downtown location is walking distance to container park and some great restaurants check the website for the tour dates as they are one saturday a month and i think they take the summer off|1

this store absolutely locks customer service bunch of kids working there that after couple months become shift managers they have no clue how to treat customer the produce and meat is not as fresh as they claim it to be and you really have to look on the expiration dates most of them expire the same day you shop i bought chicken that stunk in my basket bow they keep the hand baskets at the exit door not the entrance door how ridiculous is that i didnt even make it to the exit door when i noticed the smell went right back to customer service and she treated me like it was my fault the chicken was spoiled no word of apology nothing if you want great customer service and fresh meat and produce go to publix|0

ive been buying my beef from oven farms for many years ive tried pretty much every cut they sell and have never been disappointed the meat is well textured and flavourful so much so that a smaller cut is just as satisfying as a larger mass produced cut in my opinion they have always been very helpful especially when it comes to special orders they have brought cuts in for me upon request no problem and they are always happy to offer advice on portion sizes for larger cuts and cooking ideas|1

my dog was a patient here until we recently moved to the states i was never all that pleased with the service or prices but since this was our first dog and trinity mews our first vet in toronto i had no real point of comparison now that i have a good vet i can confidently say this place sucks first off it is way expensive my dog suffers from frequent hot spots which are now being cleared up by my new vet with the help of hypoallergenic food and what i pay now for a visit and topical medicine 80 would have cost me between 120 and 150 previously being a completely new dog owner who really loves my pooch i was also a sucker to buy all the extras the vet suggested i should get i would often spend 300 plus when visiting for routine shots or check ups the vet himself was fine in terms of bedside manner but nothing to write home about but what pushed me to write this completely negative review is the horrible customer service we have been getting since we left it has been a now month long struggle to get them to forward our records to our new insurance company we have made 4 phone calls to them personally in addition to the phone calls our insurance company has made trying to get them to send over the files surprisingly they charge 35 for this service and we gave them credit card information 2 weeks ago but when we called today to follow up because the insurance people had still not received the paperwork they told us they dont accept amex after the approx 2000 that we spent there in the 15 years our dog was a patient the fact that they dont have the courtesy to do this one small task seriously to fax over some freaking paperwork is unacceptable the only good thing about this place was mark one of the assistants he was the only genuinely nice and friendly person that i dealt with and he legitimately cared about my dog bring your money elsewhere there have got to be far better vet clinics in to|0

weve been using tisdale boarding services for our dog for the last 3 years while its difficult to let someone else care for your pet while your e out of town nancy and her staff have always made me feel comfortable knowing that my dog is in good hands the nature trail walks and one on one time keep him entertained and happy until i return the grooming services leave him smelling like he just had a spa day when we pick him up we recently boarded our 14 year old cat with tisdale as well nancy and her staff made sure to care for even the smallest of his needs and kept him safe and happy while we were on vacation i dont know what we would do without tisdale it really is the best pet care|1

ive spent quite a lot of money at this salon over almost two years on manicures and pedicures i am in fact a regular customer and i am particularly a fan of mandy however when it really counted on the day before a big wedding they refused to fit me in to do a nail repair on one chipped nail i had just gotten my manicure there two days prior it would have taken about 15 minutes this is not good customer service and i will seriously be rethinking my loyalty|0

cute little place with lots of seating i came with a friend and we ordered snacks i love baked goods sweet and savoury so i was excited to sink my teeth into some goodness unfortunately my excitement was in vain for my expectations were met with utter mediocrity the hot chocolate was pretty good but the ham and cheese tart was so rubbery and hard that it was essentially inedible i had one bite and left the rest even the meringue was not good the meringue meringue is like pure sugar how do you mess that up it was rough and crumbly not good on the bright side i got all of that for 5 and service was friendly|0

ill be honest im a biq snob i rarely eat biq out because i do a better job than most any place ive been that being said i wanted to try this place after a number of people that have had my biq said it was good it was ok with possibilities but not really a diamond in the rough our server lost our original order when we added some chili cheese fries to our order while our fries were delivered in about 15 minutes the remainder of our lunch took 50 minutes to be delivered then unfortunately our order was wrong we got cheese smothered grilled chicken instead of smoked chicken the pulled pork was cold almost like it had been pulled from the cooler and not completely warmed ribs brisket pulled chicken were good i like my it louis style ribs to be a bit more juicy these were good but i personally would like a bit less trimming of the fat sides were good except for ranch style beans which seemed days old the server did credit our bill 6 for the cold pulled pork and also didnt charge us for our drinks overall poor first impression but enough possibilities to make a return visit probable|0
once again clear protection is horrible when it comes to customer service besides having no techs in my area and having to buy 3 new sensors and install them myself and call them to install in my system and install new batteries in a door sensor and motion detector i was call last friday when i was out of town that the overhead garage door sensor alarmed it was false so i call monday and told my story to stephanie who said she would call back with info but she went home at 4 am without calling me back with answers anyone looking for alarm company make sure they have support in your area and in bakersfield dont use clear protection because they dont stand by their products or word|0

global trans is an absolute nightmare company while looking for a freight broker to use for my company i came across global trans i was dealing with a man named evan shine who promised me the moon and stars as far as customer service he seemed great when it came time to actually provide customer service and step up to the plate though he was nowhere to be found every single person in this company must be trained to give people the run around there were so many occasions where bills came in with additional charges that were clearly unwarranted but took weeks of emails to get credited truckers missed appointments and global trans still tried to bill us additional charges even though our clients took the day off to be home waiting for delivery so many emails needed to be sent each time just to get any action at all i have dealt with a lot of freight brokers in my time but this was really stunning almost every invoice that came in had an error in billing the final straw being when we needed to file a claim for damaged material i gathered all the pertinent information original material bills replacement material bills original shipping bills replacement shipping bills claim form photos i did my part david barman in charge of the claims department told me that he submitted the claim our behalf in october claims generally take about a month to process so i gave it that long before i started following up every time i emailed him he said there was no new news and it still needed to be reviewed by the freight company i said it was very peculiar for it to take this long and asked if there was anyone else i could follow up with he told me the freight company has up to six months and there was no one else to follow up with in the mean time evan tried to win back our business by offering our next five shipments for free we declined because that company had done enough damage and we didnt want to invite more i followed up with the freight company myself yesterday at the six month point to check on our claim and it had never been submitted please please please if you ever come across this company stay as far away as possible|0
so i have descent lashes but they are pretty much straight and i have to curl them everyday which is just time consuming and when they got wet or had too much steam they would fall flat which was annoying at times anyone who is obsessed with lashes like myself knows that if your skin is good all you need is a little lash enhancement and you are ready to go i have been searching for someone who has mastered eyelash lifting for a while now i had individuals two summers ago and they ruined my lashes for a month and then i had a perm last summer and my lashes looked short and way too kinky needless to say i was unhappy with both and kind of put the possibility of ever having perfectly curled lashes on the back burner well it is summer time again and i have my trip coming up this weekend and thought i would just put on individual lash clusters and fill them as needed being that i work in antiquing skincare my laser media mention abel and yelp when booking and i will hook you up and i am also a make up artist i have the tools to do this however i am also male and do not like wearing make up cosmetics i searched online for lash lift technicians and found olga i can not even begin to express how excited i am that i have finally found my lash girl she is very sweet and accommodating she performs the services in her comfortable and inviting home however she is available to travel to you for an additional fee and let me tell you whether you chose to go to her or have her come to you you can not find someone with better pricing that also has an amazing technique she explained the entire process before starting and reiterated as she was performing the actual treatment we also just had a great conversation i normally always get compliments on my skin and lashes and olga has made my lashes even more gorgeous than before and best part is they are even healthier than before and the curl is exactly what i wanted fluffy full and long it is so nice to get ready in the morning and when i reach for the curler and look in the mirror my lashes are already perfect bye bye eyelash curler olga thank you so much again for getting me to my eyelash goals and restoring my faith in eyelash enhancements i will be seeing you in a few weeks for a touch up|1
peggy is seemingly nice what a front she convinced me that i had so many things wrong with my teeth in order to get several unnecessary procedures i felt like my teeth were in horrible condition every time i visited her office she actually said i needed veneers before my front teeth cracked she did a soft credit check without my permission to see if i could afford it i now see a new dentist who says my teeth are in great shape as all of my other dentists have done hes only questioned the work a peggy did because he couldnt understand why it was necessary my spouse had the same experience|0
so originally i loved taking my son to childrens campus too up until they had to move locations to hard ave and thomas this area is horrible and the office is disgusting and very unclean after moving to this location i noticed that the children were always sick and the staff wouldnt stick to the sick policy my son was enrolled in a total of three and half months he was ill six different times two in which required overnight hospitalization he ranged from getting a cold that required antibiotics to pink eye to coming down with an infection that included at 104 degree fever unfortunately this place on camelback and and street i would highly recommend but since closing the doors there and moving all of the kids to childrens campus on thomas i wouldnt recommend you take your child there|0
my friend and i came here around am on saturday after seeing our hotels disappointing breakfast bar there is almost nowhere in gloria to get breakfast except for this place normally i dont go to dennis but i made an exception this time around because i was starving the menu was surprisingly big and you can customize any dish to a certain extent without getting additional charges our waitress was very friendly and inviting which was nice a on rainy morning that canceled our plans to visit up that day i ordered the philly cheesesteak omelet which was a little greasy but not too bad my friend ordered some pancakes and eggs combo the server brought her the wrong style of eggs and took a minute to get her scrambled ones this isnt the greatest breakfast place in the world but it was acceptable at the moment|1
this place is am a ze izz zing i was a walk in they had a cancellation earlier so they offered to see me same day and it was the best decision ive made regarding my dental health rates beat my regular dentist their in house payment plan is the best one ive found in phoenix ive been to 3 other places and called a million others they are the the nicest people you will meet from the front office staff the doctor the dental assistant the music the office is clean the list goes on the technology is amazing and what i love most is they took the time to listen to my needs and gave me all my options i cant wait for my in vas sign process to start because i am so confident that i will have the smile of dreams for wedding next year im 35 years old and ive been waiting so long to get my teeth fixed for an affordable price and they were able to help me achieve this i dont write many yelp reviews unless a place really deserves it but premier ortho deserves 10 stars|1

food was great but the inside of the restaurant was very dirty straw wrappers everywhere and pieces of food and such if they did a better job cleaning it would have a 5 star rating everything was fresh|1
it was a rather enjoyable stay i was looking for a place with a heated pool and a nice breakfast and they did not disappoint was very amazed by their breakfast and gave you plenty of options the beds were comfortable and i got a great night sleep the only reason why i didnt give it 5 stars was because one of the ac units in the hallway was blowing out a funky smell may be i just have a sensitive nose though|1
i was in need of a color and trim and two friends recommended this salon they had never been there but had heard good things so i decided to give it a shot i had a consultation on february with and it went pretty well therefore i decided to make an appointment for service i arrived a few minutes early for my appointment there was no greeter but there were four stylists and they all looked in my direction when i entered yet no one said hello this should have been my first clue that it wasnt going to be a fun experience within five minutes of me sitting there they were all finished with the clients they were working on still no acknowledgement they all started to move about the salon going to the back even walking by me because the space is not that big talking to each other and you guessed it still no one said a word to me i am now 8 minutes past my appointment time one person started to sweep and it was only then that she offered a very insincere hows your day i got up and went outside to talk on the phone because i really couldnt believe that i had just experienced after a few minutes jessica slightly opened the door asked my name and told me that she would be ready when i was ready really i contemplated going back inside as i really needed the services as i was going out of the country for a while but then my voice of reason won and i got in my car and left note to revolution ego location and decor doesnt make you a high end salon customer service should be at the core of your business obviously you didnt need my money and i definitely didnt need your service|0
this is one of the worst establishment ive ever been to for management for time management and appointment for 1000 am almost 1100 am the car wasnt even touched yet a list to say i was supposed to wait for an oil change bunch of kids running the place obviously dont know what theyre doing it does to say will never be back there again|0
been there a few times was not bad the first time i went only complaint i had was their was more side dish than main course so i felt like i was getting a sample of the main dish curry chicken goat etc while paying full price went again and didnt even finish my meal i guess they were having an off day with the flavor so ill be looking for another restaurant soon|0

this place has decent food but slightly pricy which would have been fine if service wasnt so retarded i walked in with my husband waited a few minutes nobody greeted us so we sat down at a 4 person table then the waitress came over and asked us to switch to a smaller table i looked around the store plenty of table for four was occupied by two people whatever we ordered two drinks and two slices of cake after one drink and two slices arrive i waited another 40 min and didnt receive my specialty coffee i asked them after 25 min in about my drink they told me its on the way and it takes a while to make by the time i said forget this i am leaving we been sitting for 30 min with nothing in front of us everythings done only then they said well our machine for coffee is broken we are waiting for someone to come to fix it are you kidding me why didnt you ask me to re select a drink when you first noticed your machine broke down or tell me that when i inquired about my drink half in we just sat there and wasted time because i thought my drink was coming so unprofessional|0

my go to store for all things the staff is amazing the clothing truly world class and the atmosphere is superb i have been shopping here for over 5 years and would not trust anyone but miranda co when it comes to my suits the quality of the experience is worth every penny and more if you care about style and want to appreciate tailoring at its finest look no further|1
imagine someone called few hours before you are suppose to load up all your stuff and do a one way move from champaign to chicago that you are not going to have a truck today only next week well that can happen if you do business with budget luckily haul came through and found a truck for me budget costumer service explained that these things happen all the time and your contract doesnt guarantee you a truck just the rate of course they hide whether it was their inventory fault and details on what caused this so you can not put the blame on them its almost like the truck not being there is an act of god when i asked whether they can reimburse me for additional expenses i incurred due to the truck not being available they responded with a may be to some limited amount but it depends on the manager approval what happened to logical customer service bottom line if you are planning a move with budget you need to realize that you are at risk of not having a truck the day of your move|0
the parrots are friendly the staff is friendly but the manager and owners son my grimm is rude i have purchased many times in the past but after dealing with my grimm i would never purchase there again after waiting two months for a delivery of a cactus i called a week prior to the delivery to see if i could get an afternoon time slot he said no i asked if i could get a 30 minute warning call he said no unlike the other nurseries around town he was not client friendly their delivery organization is badly run if you cant have someone pick it up it is better to shop somewhere else|0
we love our clinic we have like may be 5 years coming to charlotte pediatric dentistry we love the way they work with the kids is super super clean super organized super friendly i have a lot good things to say about this clinic thanks for your excellent job|1
my review is based off of the two times ive used their services i first saw the veto fix van at the south mountain trail head after my son and i finished our ride we made our way over to check it out and were immediately blown away by how well organized the interior of the van is tristan the mechanic and driver was very friendly and answered some of our questions basically you schedule a service day and time with them and they show up either at your home or workplace you hand your bike over to them and they start to work on it right there on your driveway you can choose to either stay and chat with them ask questions about your bike or return to work if you are busy i have done both if you choose the latter they will give you a call when your bike is done they have the same range of services a bike shop does but will probably carry less parts than your typical labs so be sure to call ahead and specify the services you need veto fix sends out an estimate of the parts and labor to you before the appointment so you are not surprised by the repair bill when its all done i think this is something all bike shops can learn from once your e ok with the estimate they order the parts you need and will contact you to make an appointment once those parts arrive this model of mobile bike repair is going to be revolutionary i love my labs and all but every time i need a service id had to transport my bike which is a mins drive for me to the shop drop it off and usually wont be able to get it back until 3 or 4 days later if you are a busy professional like me veto fix can save you a lot of precious time alas a good business model wouldnt warrant 5 stars by itself it is also tristan i awesome mechanic skills and customer service he listens to your input and concerns and pays attention to the small details he truly goes out of the way to take care of you and your bike in summary scheduling a repair appointment with veto fix is a whole new experience the feeling when they hand you your bike back tuned and working 110 is beyond description my wife remarked that i was smiling like a kid on christmas morning when i was riding my tuned up bike around the veto fix van in front of our house give them a try for your next repair needs you wont regret it|1
no one wants to visit an auto repair facility nick and frank at nab lower burrell are class acts they offer just about all the vehicle services you could ever need at reasonable prices notice the reasonable in the previous sentence if lowest price is your only deciding criteria in a vehicle repair facility shop around i would prefer to have the job done right the first time with quality napa parts rather than have to return to the facility because something went wrong or the job was half assed it happens ive been there|1
they have been the title company for my ref they have all been very nice and either answered right away or called me back i have not closed yet but the process has been easy they sent a notary to my office he was running a bit late but was nice enough to call well ahead of time to let me know and updated me when he was on his way|1
best crab bisque in us kept going back daily while in i town getting giant cup of it wow its unbelievable|1
ive seen this cart on library mall for years but ive never ventured to order something from them what spring rolls how good could they really be and smoothies nah i want a hot lunch what was i thinking because this place is delicious after hearing others rave about this place i decided to check it out today for lunch and im so glad i did because this will forever be a favorite 350 for a massive fresh spring roll filled with cabbage spinach cucumbers and avocado you can add some protein to it by choosing shrimp tofu or chicken for the same price when i say massive i mean that its burrito sized spring roll wrappers arent exactly meant to hold that much liquid so eat fast once you get going but even if your e not speedy the mess at the end is still totally worth the deliciousness throughout i also find this to be a particularly awesome invention its a salad on the go a few other carts also sell these gigantic spring rolls but i really like this carts sauce compared to a different cart i also got a a small smoothie mango with pineapple and it was tasty without being overly sweet a small smoothie with the spring roll came out to be 625 and it was more than enough for lunch the only downside is the wait she prepares your order one at a time so spring rolls are freshly wrapped and smoothies freshly blended|1
i needed two front tires desperately i got off work around 430 my ex husband recommended this tire shop as they are a client if his i figured i would not get tires today i stopped by as they are close to my work leon told me that the tires were not in stock but he could have them within 45 minutes and the price was cheaper than everywhere else i had called i pulled out of there right around 6 leon saved the day now i can drive to tucson as planned on friday thank you sooo much|1

i had to take my puppy there for his vaccinations this was my puppy first visit to the vet and it was interesting to say the least as soon as we pulled up he puked in my car all i remember is his head bobbing and weaving and my boyfriend yelling hes about to puke get out so in the process of getting him out of the car he puked on the passenger side the lady at the front desk was really nice and gave me a roll of paper towels and a spray bottle to assist with the cleanup the sign in process was easy and we only had to wait about 10 minutes im not a big fan of the neighborhood but ive got to say that everyone was really nice plus the prices are reasonable ive worked at a vet office in the past so i know how much they mark up their services i would definitely use this place again for vaccinations and i highly recommend it its an awesome clinic that is doing great work for the community|1
this place was empty on a sunday night but decided to check it out because of the high ratings from the reviewers below let me start off by saying the interior is super cute i love the design and its definitely insta gram friendly however the service was awful anytime i asked a question they would answer in such a condescending way for instance i asked them whats your most popular milk tea and they said theres only one the rosey i milk tea even though there were more listed on the menu they also looked visibly annoyed when i asked them for a napkin okay then the milk tea itself was okay it was really sweet but decent i havent tried the food so cant comment on that i probably wont be returning|0
ordered delivery said 30 minutes almost 2 hours later a raw stuffed crust hardly showed up with wings that have been put into the microwave who knows how many times horrible avoid at all costs|0
first off let me just say if your e looking for an elegant yet exciting and vibrant experience the location of this plaza is perfect everything is calm on the outside but inside its whats up my husband and i know personally know the owner what a welcoming spirit this place has its sparkling clean great music and mesmerizing with the nitrogen gas as the team members are preparing your freshly made ice cream if you prefer pure homemade ice cream this is the place for you cream is try also has non dairy choices as well we will definitely be back and enjoy with our little and share the exciting experience of eating ice cream its super fun here thanks for coming to the vegas valley and enhancing the morale even more|1

chris is awesome so easy to work with allowed us to change plans and add another club on another night didnt charge us a thing and the best of it all on our last night in vegas we chose to go to a different club blush and the whole experience there was just awful but chris came through when i called him at 1230am to see if he could hook us up somewhere not only did he get us into playboy and moon at the palms as vips last minute we also got free drinks and a complimentary limo ride there what a fantastic way to end our vegas trip i would definitely work with chris again and recommend him to everyone|1
i was very unhappy with this company starting the lack of quality i tried fresh home clean for about 5 months i know if i wasnt happy why stay with them well i was trying to give them a chance i understood that they were a new company and i tried to be considerate of the situation i always received the trainee and she was always alone i was promised on every clean that next time there will be a crew that never occurred the cleans themselves left a lot to be desired dust on several surfaces crumbs on coffee tables hardwood only vacuumed door window with no coverings not cleaned garbage bins not emptied or cleaned the list goes on i suggest not to use this company unless you are willing to pay someone to just come and look at the items on your mantel|0

this place is a cluster if you enjoy waiting for hours and having your insurance company bilked this is the place to go horrible at educating all they wanted to do is tell us worst case scenario every time we go in ordered tests for no reason example arc for gym gestational diabetes only problem is my wife is anemic and the test would be inaccurate not to mention she is 36 weeks along and already testing glucose levels oh and then its the all saving gli be ride medicine i bet they forget to tell you the drug manufacture clearly says to stop taking it two weeks before birth or your baby will require nicu care because of extreme hypoglycemia they want her to take it till she gives birth this place needs more training or have its license revoked do your research its your life and your unborn childs life it is sad profits drive this place more than meeting patients needs get second opinions do research print it and educate your doctor|0

what an epic fail this property management company is truly horrible they come in to the area and make it look like a prison with all the cameras they installed cameras everywhere then put in a new gate security system which never works even though the old system worked fine there is radio link connecting the back gate with the front gate which this hoa put in and the antennas literally stand about 25 feet in the air its ugly and unnecessary since both control boxes for each gate have phone modems and phone lines which was meant so we could buzz in our guests at the gate without leaving our homes but not anymore cause the new system never works and when this new system doesnt work they bring in this outhouse looking guard shack which is manned by someone who doesnt have a clue what theyre doing one night i counted 12 cars lined up at the main gate wait for the person in the shack to figure out how to open the gate epic also got rid of the roving security patrol that the residents wanted and fought for so now instead of having a security guard walking the neighborhood who could report crime happen in the neighborhood we have cameras and a broke ass gate system which bow anyone can get in by just waiting at the gate till it opens stupid in talking with other residents in the area they are saying that fines are being levied for things that were settled with prior hoa companies but whoever runs this company doesnt seem to care all they want is the money there is also a rumor that our dues are going up go figure if you have any say what so ever on who manages your property stay away form epic on the other hand if you dont care who your hoa is and you are looking to buy my place is going on the market soon the reason epic hoa|0

we needed gutters cleaned out on a two story roof sarah was very nice came over to the house and gave us a quote of sehr for a couple guys to come clean them out said it would probably a couple hours worth of work the day of three men showed up two younger guys and one older gentleman first he asked me for a nonskid rug to put under their ladder if im going to pay sehr you should bring your own rug then he proceeded to stand on the ground shouting orders at the two younger guys and never did a darn thing he then charged me sehr i said this is not what i was quoted his reply was that i was quoted wrong then to top it all off not only did he charge me for two guys but charged me for himself too while we are happy the gutters are cleaned out the price wasnt worth it we were going to hire them to spread mulch around our entire property but decided not to hire them after this furthermore with family living in a nearby condo complex their board called them for quotes regarding various jobs around the property after our experience we warned them our family is on the board of the association well they gave them five work orders to test them out the association was and is looking for new grounds crew after three months none of the orders were ever finished needless to say they lost out on this job too seems a shame that someone who presents as a very nice person is getting a bad rap due to some if the people associated with her business we try and support local businesses but they need to figure things out first perhaps growing pains who knows|0
worst place to go to watched a woman receive cold soup while dining in today and a young man showed her where the microwave was so that she could personally reheat her own soup i then went up two three different workers getting the same response until one worker told me they would get a manager so make sure not to come to this manera unless you want to cook your own food they treated the situation like it was nothing and went about their business cleaning out the trash the poor woman who got over pay for a soup she had to cook thats a ridiculous and i hope your manager lovell i should look into who was working 1052013 to take care of that staffing problem|0

i recently adopted a dog from a rescue that had been returned eight times due to behavioral issues i came to find out that the dog had some severe separation anxiety issues and a severe food aggression issue the food aggression was a very dangerous behavior the rescue sent mica diaz out to give me some tips on how to train this dog so that he could live in my home safely he had been tied to a tree for 4 years and not had any human interaction and had been given very little to eat or drink therefore he became very protective of his food it was like having a wild animal in my home i did one session with mica and she gave me tips that were extremely successful with this dog and now he has no food aggression issues and his separation anxiety is fading daily i sincerely believe that mics training advice saved this dogs life and possibly mine as well|1

i decided to try this place because its close to my new home my pedicure was good massage was nice and the price was good 20 for basic no call us remover but included a scrub however my pedicure was so short my feet arent bad so i dont need a lot of work but most places make up the time with a little extra massage nope in and out of the chair in may be 30 minutes charge less for an express pedicure if thats what im getting to top off my disappointing experience i handed the girl 40 and asked for change she counted out 15 and looked at me and said uh when i asked if she had a 5 she said thank you i didnt get to chose how much i was tipping her she was taking 5 for what i got she should have gotten 3|0

i decided to give do i a shot at some of my health issues because of what an acquaintance had said about her i usually like applied kinesiology a muscle testing method to determine core level issues and what kind of supplements work best after three months of working with her i told her i was feeling worse with my energy and brain fog and after our session and determining what kind of supplements tested well she just turned to me and said your are sick this kind of shocked me because i appear to be in fairly good shape at 63 when i asked her if i could cut down on the number of supplements i was having to take 2 i day she said to me you need more not less and that was it when someone is in a weakened state we tend to want to trust our doctor have our best interest at heart with those comments and poor bedside manner i decided not to go back get a refund on my unused supplements which the office gladly did and i never went back early on i asked for some of her records so i could see what she determined as some of my issues that she had mentioned verbally lung parasites infections stomach gut stuff and the progress we had made her comment was i do not supply notes about our session you can take notes if you like but i do not supply records i told her how hard it is to listen during a short session you only have so much time and take notes too she did not have an answer to that except that it was my problem if you are looking for a functional medicine holistic doctor do your homework get references not easy to do but do not leap before you look live and learn sometimes|0

we accidentally chose pickup on grub hub instead of delivery and the guy called us being so rude i understand i chose the wrong delivery method but i already paid for the pizza it shouldnt have been that big of a deal after that i asked if they could just deliver it it was their party box among other things so it wasnt just one regular pizza and they said they had a 2 mile delivery radius and couldnt come all the way out to us i looked it up on google maps it was 22 miles really so we met him at the 2 mile mark which was a restaurant off cochran road i asked the delivery driver if i could talk to the manager and he said he was the manager it was just so ridiculous they couldnt drive the extra 2 miles after i offered to compensate them for gas he said they had no other deliveries at the time and no pending orders so it shouldnt have been an issue but he accused me of jeopardizing his job and paying his rent ect if it meant that much to them i would understand and accept the outcome but he was so incredibly rude and on a power trip the box was awful clearly we will never order from them again|0

i was referred to steven from my bookkeeper as someone closer to my office that could file our corporate taxes he was much cheaper than my current cpa so i thought it might be worth a shot it was not a good experience he began the relationship by insulting the cpa that i had worked with for 8 years then when i asked questions over email about how why we were filing taxes differently than we had for 8 years he was dismissive with short answers or no answers at all he seemed insulted that i would even ask a question he then offered me a tax planning session for year end planning i accepted so we met in october and november to talk about year end he informed me 5 days before the end of the year on his plan when i asked why he didnt notify me of the plan before the final hour he blamed it on me and then insulted our processes which was his typical response if you paid me i wouldnt work with steven again|0
i went to taps 3 times first time i ordered a nonalcoholic beer i would have even been happy with something domestic but they had nothing at all i perused the menu and found that everything was overpriced second visit around 10pm on sunday memorial day weekend it was closed i figured it was because of my poorly timed visit i went again at about 945pm saturday june 1 no lights no cars no customers no employees im guessing that matthew the guy who wrote the first review is a shill nobody else felt as good about the place as he did so it appears that they are no longer in business too bad the area needs a hopping place with a relaxed atmosphere|0
bought draft today at target i used the right coupons for the right products and did everything within targets coupon policy yet i was treated like a criminal by not only one person but three including the manager one at check out another at guest services and the manager i did not try to cheat the system in anyway but i was treated as if i was stealing the products one worker even turned to her manager and said the total went from like 70 to 7 what should i do wif is that i was with my two kids so i stayed calm and did not make a scene and paid for what i needed to pay for the products when they decided that it was a valid transaction i love shopping at target thats why i have a red card and i am a very loyal customer but i dont appreciate being treated like a criminal because i use coupons im sorry but im not rich and i need to save on things i buy extreme couponing couponing|0

johnnie car in os or as the hubby and i call it johnnie is is a nice comfortable italian restaurant we especially like the private booths with tables in them they offer family size portions as well as individual what we especially enjoy is that this restaurant can make almost everything how you want it since im allergic to so many things including tomato this idea comes in handy for me ive changed red sauce meals to spectacular alfredo sauce dishes johnnie is gets it right every time great salads the most friendliest staff around johnnie is is the place to eat oh did i mention that they have original italian sodas and yummy berlin is anyway you might want to check them out i believe they have family nights where you get a family size dish for half price you cant beat it|1

great place to get active in fun way but got the unlimited two hour pass from group on came later in the evening on wednesday so it would be slower the crowd was mostly 20 some year olds including myself the activities were all fun it was basically empty so the two hour pass was perfect to go about doing everything there is no time limit on each individual course only your time there as a whole did the suspended gym the paintball bazooka thing the wall climbing the circular pedal stay thing the slide was closed and the ninja warrior course there was more to do but i twisted my ankle on the last ride and i lost the last hour of my time the cashier savannah i was really sweet and really tried helping us 5 star experience up until that moment they lose stars be they didnt offer much help regarding my ankle and the manager didnt even try to re compensate the hour lost she couldnt care less i know its not their responsibility or duty i understand i hurt myself but when the employee shows more empathy willingness to help and options than the manager does you know theres an issue|0

ive been visiting this shop since they were at their cowell location and its been consistently amazing this location is right down the street from copper star which is always amazing too and has the most welcoming energy coming from the people inside their selection is vast and the prices are low they care about what you get from their crystals minerals oils and other products not so much about how much money they get from selling them i got a tarot reading from an older woman at this location which was also really nice and welcoming i love it truly truly the best|1
disaster they were out of the key smears marketed then after waiting in a slow moving line which only had about five people but one must actually wait through two lines they forgot our order and had to start over fortunately i had shoved the receipt in my pocket which i normally wouldnt do so i could prove that i paid although i didnt have any way to prove whether or not the bagels had actually been received i spent over 30 minutes trying to buy 6 bagels and a tub of cream cheese my son ended up being 10 minutes late for a 30 minute piano lesson while standing in the ordering line then again in the paying line then in the cluster waiting to get my bagels i realized how jacked the einstein ordering system is it took three different people to sell me six bagels any one of which could screw up i wont be back|0
my one reason for liking this salon was selina and she is no longer there i have since found her thank goodness and still am receiving excellent hair care my stars are dropped for them because instead of telling me that she was no longer with them and went to another salon the owners chose to lie and tell me she had quit and decided to be a stay at home mother believing them i sought out looking for a new hair stylist not cool i found out they knew that it was the furthest from the truth i also had instances of being charged different amounts and the price for my short hair became quite outrageous i am glad she left as i will not be returning to this over priced salon|0
been using the same cleaning lady that the rest of my family has been using for years decided to try this service given the great deal of having landscaping included for free with the cleaning service first time around was not that great i was disappointed in the service provided by the cleaning ladies and they took off with some of my cleaning products not on purpose anyway i could have gone back to my old cleaning lady but she had her own issues eg never cleaned behind stuff but decided to give these guys another shot new set of cleaning ladies showed up and i could not be happier for 105 usd i get two cleaning ladies that scum my 3550 so it house from top to bottom nothing is missed and everything is spic and span landscapers that pull all weeds trim bushes and willing to do anything else i ask them eg plant some new bushes for me i would recommend this service to anybody living in no trails or coronado ranch i only removed one star from this review because of the rocky first experience|1
lets just say that if i could give less than one star i would i had ordered here once before and it took them 1 12 hours to deliver they had given us the pizza for free so i decided to give them a second shot i ordered on a tuesday night not like a friday or saturday and after over an hour i called them back and they stated that they couldnt find my address keep in mind they had delivered to me before and i live near major landmarks that any gas can find then after i called and read them the riot they said that i was out of their delivery area but they were going to go out of their way and bring it to me as i am sitting here over 2 12 hours has gone by and still no pizza need less to say i will not be ordering from here again|0

while the food is fresh and tends to be considerably good the very slow service is a huge turn off if your e in a rush dont go here and expect to be out of the door within minutes i avoid this place like the plague rather go to a big chain to grab whatever i need rude slow and tries to rip people off if he gets snappier service gets some class and stops trying to rip people off id go back too bad because the food is pretty good|0
sales rep was just fine but the installer that they sent to my house to measure was a piece of work he called attempting to show up 90 mins earlier than scheduled of course he wanted to finish his day early and was visibly annoyed upon arrival that i could only accomodate him 45 minute early instead then as soon as he walked in he looked at the window and said he couldnt take this job and hed have the store contact me with someone else but itll cost you more he shouted as he bumble i away keep in mind i had shown the sales rep a picture of the window to begin with so not sure how this even became an issue waited over a week no word from the store that at this point had my 50 deposit for 3 weeks at this point when i called in they assigned another installer who when i described the window increased the installation cost by 350 over what the store quoted had to go into the store to request a refund of my deposit and the rep had the nerve to try to talk me into spending the money on other windows that was the last straw went elsewhere and guess what got a higher end product at a better price including installation|0
yes it is cheap yes i it is the only place in the whole neighborhood with asian cuisine but no it is not worth it the spicy is just salty with some crushed chilies in in we had to add sriracha sauce to make it taste good in fact we had to add sauce to make it taste like anything if you really want dumplings and not spend too much money go to chinatown and buy some frozen and eat them at home or any other place with a high concentration of asian people i had such high hopes for montreal chinese crepes dumplings based on their rave reviews but clearly none of these have tried qing hua in their lives save yourself the long line of angry old ladies screaming at each other and hobbling over the steps for some sweet and spicy dumplings they are neither sweet not spicy not worth the wait|0

no customer service from any of the adult men on shift at 615pm on 4817 visited this location have never had papa murphy before the young woman greeted me and was very friendly and helpful she asked if i had been there before and i said no i told her i would like the 7 pizza and she directed me to pick it up at the cashiering area there were 3 men huddled around the register none of them acknowledged me for about 5 minutes i can guess there was an issue with their register or a pick up order they did not talk to me or ask what i needed the whole time i stood there as the only customer in the store i would have gladly paid cash plus tip or anything to expedite the process the young woman mouthed im sorry to me after i stood there about 3 minutes in silence it is not her fault as she was doing her job at the pizza bar and managing phone calls while the men ignored the phone ringing i am genuinely disappointed in the older men on staff as a man speak up if there is an issue and handle the situation or at least acknowledge your customers blatantly ignoring someone is so disrespectful and infuriating i walked out of the store after a couple more minutes with no assistance|0

this place has lots of potential unfortunately the alcohol is watered down hopefully the new owners will rectify this major issue that has persisted for many months under the old owner jimmy the regulars are mostly a good bunch of people but look out for 1 or 2 shady characters who will offer you drugs or ask to borrow money from you|0

went the other day with questions about selling my extensive up record collection from the 60s80s also questions about turntables looking around they have a large collection of lips from 100 to the rare what was most impressive and commendable was the time and information given to me by the man behind the counter owner he knew i wasnt there to make a purchase but took the time to educate me about turntables and pricing lips if i ever decide to do business this will be my go to shop|1
over the last 2 months i have had nothing but hassles and headaches dealing with the customer service department of aps the cars are nice enough but either they are incompetent or incapable of making billing concerns right due to their internal system limitations i have had 4 accounts 3 rental properties plus my home with aps for 19 years and under their sure pay arrangements my monthly billing payments went smoothly in august i simply wanted to break off from my sure pay arrangements my ex husbands bill on his one rental property what a nightmare i literally spent hours on the phone attempting to explain what i needed done and attempting to confirm that the new billing arrangements were in effect now autopsy as they are phasing out the old tried and true sure pay system i had to go through gyrations to get this accomplished eg they now put my 2 rental properties under one account on which i set up my new autopsy then after drafting one payment due they lost or ignored my banking information which resulted in my getting a disconnect notice when i had thought everything was on track also they had to kill my old account numbers in order for me to set up the new billing arrangements now i have no access to my rental property billing history that i might need for tax purposes aps did admit that they are undergoing a major website redesign when i suggested to them that they were totally incapable of handling any service needs when the customer has more than one account with aps still that is no excuse for any customer having to spend hours on the phone and online with aps to get what seemed to be a relatively simple customer service task accomplished and i dont trust that the saga is yet over too bad there is no alternative to aps which means there is little incentive for them to improve their service|0
i had a horrible experience with this place first of all i was greeted by an ex prison guard when i walked in she was belligerent and at one point told me gruffly you do not have insurance coverage what a stupid thing to say to a person who most certainly has insurance i was fitted for compression stocking by a guy who admittedly doesnt usually fit people for stockings i do orthotics he said well why the hell is he helping me with garments i ended up with expensive stockings that are painfully tight at the ankles i will never go to any hanger location ever again if you need compression order online from lymphedema products you will get better service from them|0
first my soda glass was dirty then i unwrapped my dirty silverware only to bite into cold dry food never again will i eat here the wait staff are sending way to much time gossiping then worried about the quality of the food they are serving they all stand in the middle of the restaurant doing nothing while the customer waits endlessly for their bill way to over priced and when i asked to speak to a manager one of the gossipy wait staff claimed she was the manager i just wonder how long before this place goes out of business|0
worst delta ive flown with the average worker is not helpful to say the least flying with a buddy pass has never been more regretful than this joyous occasion today checking into an airport at am with intentions of being on a flight at 745 and them turning you away because they claim there are no seats but allowed others to get on as standby is ridiculous than to be told youll get on the next on at 1040 and when boarding comes around your e then again told you have to wait until up is quite frustrating to deal with these frustrations you tell the attendant this is complete bullshit and she tells you to watch your mouth as though shes your mother can you see why i will never fly with delta again|0
bought 2 circuit breakers for a new ac installation they were the wrong ones and i tried taking them back a few days later they refused to refund my money even though i had not used them they said breakers have to be returned the same day the contacts still had grease on them and it was obvious that they were never used but the cashier refused to even look at them i will never shop at he again loves usually has better customer service|0
they did two of the most beautiful granite bathroom vanities we get compliments every time we have guests very professional and knowledgeable would never even think about going anywhere else|1
i used to not think of going anywhere else the cost was always lower than anywhere else and i never felt like i was told i needed unnecessary repairs until recently i walked in right at opening time and noticed right away that everyone was new i didnt see anyone that i was used to seeing already i didnt feel comfortable then i met the owner and another lady that said she was from corporate office the lady did not look like anyone ive ever seen from a corporate office jeans i shirt this is going to sound unusual but the owner teddy was overly friendly teddy greeted everyone who came in with a hug and said hi im teddy and this is my shop just too much some people might call it great customer service but i dont comes off as fake and uncomfortable the caffeine he had just while i was there 2 red bulls starbucks anyway i was there est thing in the morning and it took an hour a half to get my oil change done i had never waited more than a half hour before these new people when teddy came to get me after the oil change and inspection he told me i needed brakes and my roger i were getting damaged by them because they were auto zone brakes and installed incorrectly i told him ive never had my brakes replaced and they should still be factory he insisted they were from auto zone and need to be replaced asap i went for a second opinion and turns out i do not need brakes and they are in fact still factory not from auto zone nothing wrong with my roger i he also had suggested my i service they must have made this recommendation just by looking at the mileage or trying to make more money because i had my i service last year i wont need it for a while by the end of all this i was late for an appointment i told teddy i didnt have time to change brakes right now and i didnt before i left he wanted to show his concern for my safety and offered to do the repairs and i could pay later if i didnt have the money i told him that wasnt the problem i was late and really had to go an offer like that doesnt sound like a good business deal at all i didnt feel genuine concern for my safety instead i saw desperation i am disappointed and i wont be back|0
i took my dog here to get bathed and groomed online it says that a corgi would be 30 i chose them because i thought that price was great when i go to pick up my dog after the service they tell me the price now for a corgi is 40 and that they changed the price a year ago she said their website is wrong and that theyve been trying to get it fixed for a year when i explained i chose them because of the price on their site she didnt seem to care poor customer service skills i will not be taking my dog here again disappointing|0
track the time you return your movies ive rented from both locations this one on silverado and the location on eastern across from ufc the location at eastern closed due to the owners not paying rent go figure and considering how many videos i rent i have been charged late fees even though i know it was not late so when that location closed i thought to try thier silverado location after renting for just a week it happened again i have been making sure that i am ret runing the movies on time recently i rented day breakers for one day i returned it the next day around 630pm i was sure it was before up because i checked the time before i left home to make sure i was not going to waste the drive down from anthem if too late anyways so yesterday i was returning another movie and was told that i had a late fee for day breakers i was very upset because i knew that i was not late thier system showed that i returned it at 830pm no way i disputed the fee and told them that the movie was not late but perhaps they scanned it late eventually the rep removed the fee but i am now 100 sure that some of the late fees are not legit if they are too busy to scan the movies in when you return them beware you may just be charged a late fee next time i suggest that you make them scan in the movies when you return them that is the only way the time of return will be correct test it yourself return a movie just before up specially when they are busy i bet you will be charged a late fee the next day|0
i was an employee of the pera club for a little over two years i wish and hope that people will read this review to find my information helpful the pera club is a private facility for sip employees their families and invited guests only to host an event at the pera club the employee has to make the reservation and be present the day of the event employees can sponsor in outside guests if the room and date are available for booking employees can only host one event each year on one day no multiple personal events at a time employees of sip must make the reservation a 300 deposit is due within 30 days of the booking the deposit is then added to the total bill prices for the venues changes every year between 1525 increase that being said the prices for rental of the location are extremely fair for the scottsdale phoenix area this facility has several different style rooms good for meetings conferences weddings birthdays graduations etc all the rooms come at a different price per rental depending on hours rented no event can be later than 1200 am with clean up being from 1200 am 100 am my reason for 4 stars is the facility is in desperate need of a facelift however the property is currently undergoing a massive renovation and things will be very nice and efficient if you have the proper connections this place makes for a nice venue|1
this is a mixed review and i had thoughts either way that would change the rating between a 1 and a 4 so i decided to break it down as follows 1 first impressions 4 stars this location is right off the freeway has plenty of parking and is located in an area with several restaurants and is also nearby the race track nothing overly fancy but just fine business people 2 check in and greeting 4 stars my company pre paid for 3 of us and everything was in order and we didnt have any problems odd moment 1 star the person at the front desk was nice checking 3 of us in to 3 different rooms but after i unloaded my luggage from my car and heading back to park she said something along the lines of make sure your coworker brings the trolly back uh what one of my guys used he luggage cart to bring things to his room and if he doesnt return it the 30 feet to the lobby this is my problem eh whatever but there is a bonus of fresh slightly burned cookies between 5 an 6 3 getting settled in 2 stars the room was large 2 queen beds with a kitchenette fridge microwave cookware etc with a view of the pool cool well found dust covering the top of the fridge dust on the microwave and a hair in the tub kinda gross but otherwise looked clean i also opened the freezer to grab the ice bucket and found a partially used cocktail possibly from the maid or the previous visitor see pics 4 sleep chill time etc 3 stars the beds were comfy and the sheets looked clean the noise level was average nothing amazing nothing bad just about right odd grosser note negative 4 stars at some point i knocked my glasses off the night stand and they fell behind so i moved the nightstand and found a pile of dust bunnies a collection of pens a bottle cap and an empty bag of beef jerky wif gross this must be on the once a year schedule to be cleaned i left the items as found less my glasses see pic 5 the breakfast after day 5 15 stars kill me its the exact same thing over and over and over and no coffee 4 out of 5 times i informed the lady running the breakfast bar that the coffee and she looked up and said coffee eee and walked away weird i assume she was making more coffee ill never know the fried eggs with black pepper were so so the first day and i grew to loathe these things day after day the round sausage patties were so so as well i had some regret after day 1 but i was able to work through the discomfort to try again the next day the toaster seems to have 2 settings carbonized black and raw i couldnt seem to cook a bagel right to save my life the fruit was gross the oranges were small bruised and a day from rot i did see some canned fruit salad but i didnt want to chance it there was oatmeal available but eh not feeling it i think the only safe bet was cereal and boxed milk or yogurt please for the love of god change the menu every other day or something i did muster the courage to try the waffle maker with the pre poured batter it was ok the lady running the breakfast seemed like she was trying but not do in so hot|0
our family had a good time at crystal lake heres a brief run down the advantages it was very affordable we rented a cabin for 85 night for all of us what a deal the le in ies on tap in the bar were just 2 too everyone was friendly and helpful we had just come from the tells where the welcome was a bit cold due to the sheer masses of people the swimming pool is huge and well maintained they even have a lifeguard on duty the sandy beach also has a lifeguard has a trampoline and other fun toys to keep kids busy you can rent a pontoon boat and or golf cart there are other activities too like mini golf sky ball volleyball playground disadvantages the hot tub was broken we missed it due to chilly temps our cabins cabin a deck faced the parking lot so it wasnt very private or nature y cabins a i are actually in the same building with a thin door separating them when our neighbors talked in normal voices we could hear them clearly this was annoying the night they decided to stay up until am we complained the next day front desk staff said we should have told them as 11pm is curfew cabin i or a frame seem to be individual buildings so may be choose those overall the cabins campground restrooms etc were clean however the windows hadnt been cleaned in a long time i opened one to let in fresh air in our cabin but came across a ton of spiders so quickly closed it back up a fresh coat of paint would be good especially to the cabins exterior mini golf deck all in all we had a very good few days and would certainly go back especially given the low budget my 8 year old says everything was his favorite|1

highly recommend my girlfriend and i were visiting montreal for the first time and had heard the city was extremely bike friendly we decided to do a bike tour our first day there to get a lay of the land and explore the city and we couldnt have asked for a better experience we chose the hour tour which included the bikes helmet and lunch with a beer at atwater market we did the tour in april but looking at their updated website now in july it looks like the hour tour has turned into the north south tour our guides name was catherine and she was simply delightful my girlfriend and i ended up being the only ones on the tour that day so we were worried it might be a little awkward but catherine was super easy going and fun and we both secretly wanted her to be our best friend when the day was done she taught us so much about the city and we got to see quite a bit there were also plenty of breaks so we hardly broke a sweat if your e worried about that sort of thing 1010 would recommend for anyone visiting the city whether your e a first timer to the city or a montreal native|1
what a bad way to run a business banner on there building as well as the recording when you call their office number states 500pm every night of the year including weekends and holidays only problem is when we went at 500 on sunday jan est and they have a sign on the door it reads they will be closed until wed jan ith 5 am that it is beyond their control we were not the only family waiting for them to open i guess they needed time off for new years to bad the babies and kids had to suffer i will not drive across town again for this treatment|0

definitely not a relaxing experience i will not be returning here even though it is in a decent location i was the only one in the salon the entire time so that should have been a warning to me i had a 6 am appointment on a week night the owner had her little girl running around screaming the entire time i was getting a pedicure i kept thinking she was going to knock things over since she was running so fast i should have listened to the other reviews but wanted to give this place a fair chance i would drive 20 minutes to go elsewhere before returning here|0
do not go here i went to regis salon for a haircut and lorraine butchered my hair she said she would cut the interior of my hair so she could keep most of the length and maintain the layers i agreed and i was brought to the shampoo area she did an okay job shampooing but the towels she used had so much color faded and strands hanging off i felt disgusted my hair was dripping wet when i got to the chair because she didnt even bother to pat it down the water seeped through the cover they put over you and needless to say i was extremely cold and uncomfortable she then began the haircut she lifted up a chunk of my hair into the air and began cutting by the second time she sounded so exhausted she only did this a few times before she began moving my hair to the side and cutting from there by the time she was done my hair was still dripping wet and i could not tell how it looked so she blew dry she used her hot tools blow dryer and two old brushes as she was blow drying my hair i began to realize what a horrible job she has done i kept quiet and resolved that i will go somewhere else to fix my hair as i did not want her touching my hair ever again my hair was butchered so much that i can not even show the bottoms leaving it down and putting it in a pony tail shows the chopping ess of her work i have a chunk of long hair where there are short layers and a chunk of short hair where i have long layers im mortified do not go here|0

our family has been here a few times and the service and food is always outstanding the nice ladies gents at the counter always greets us with genuine smiles and our little guy has never come out of there without them offering a little cup of sherbet on the house seriously warms my heart everything we have ever ordered from windy city has been delicious and freshly made hot dogs yum wings better than the other guys french fries yes please pizza puff ummm i but nothing can compare or even stand a chance against their italian beef sandwich with everything dont you dare take anything off of it wet they dip the entire sandwich in au jus and you can get it as wet as your heart desires you can not order this sandwich without having them dip it into the au jus i would think that would be somewhat illegal somewhere there is some sort of relish that they slap on there that has carrots peppers onions that will literally knock your socks off that relish with the thinly sliced juicy roast beef gooey cheese and the savory wetness from the au jus will do a number on your taste buds trust me my mouth is literally salivating as i type this if youve never tried it i judge you hard go there order it then thank me later i bye|1

first of all i went there last night 10 minutes to closing hoping to see if i could get a slice but the door was locked i showed the gentleman my watch indicating it was still 10 minutes to closing he had no idea i was going to get a slice may be i was going to order a pizza however he wouldnt open the door tonight my coworker and i decided we would order a pizza so i went online to their website and ordered the large special with the three pop we ordered a simple pizza pepperoni mushroom pineapple and believe it or not there were only 16 pieces of pineapple on the pizza yes i counted it i couldnt believe my eyes when we went into the restaurant to pick up the pizza the fellow behind the counter handed me the three pop that came with the pizza and i asked him for a bag he said we dont have any bags i was wondering how it was possible that every time i order a pizza from pizza pizza near where i live the three pop always come in a plastic bag yet at this particular pizza pizza not only do they really skimp on the pineapple but they dont have bags for your pop all i can say to this is that im glad i dont live downtown and have to shop at that particular restaurant on a regular basis if i want pizza what i go back probably not unless i was desperate for something to eat at 2 in the morning and even that being said i would probably just drive over to yonge street and find something else that was open i really hope the pizza pizza reads this for their with birthday and sees that this is the type of quality customer service that they offer at the front street location not|0

the heart and soul of grassroots theater in pittsburgh the arcade comedy theater is something every city should have comedy is one of the hardest arts to perform and in this electronic world it is my favorite art to see performed live behind the plain brick wall that practically screams cliche comedy club you will typically watch 56 comedians perform for as little as 5 with a student id the nature of the business is of course that a lot of artists just arent that good and believe it or not this 5 theater is no exception but for 2 more you can make them all funny as that is the cover charge for bob forget the 2 drink minimum that leaves you with a couple of overpriced beers and a slight buzz bring the last 3 pars thats been behind the mayo jar in your fridge for about a month and have yourself a real cheap night out most of the comedians are very funny and they really know how to keep the audience engaged theres just something about this place that is charming in its simplicity nothing but a curtain dividing the theater from the lobby and of course only seating 75 in the audience makes for a very personal experience its clearly a quirky little theater and is most definitely one i would urge all of you to attend|1
awful dont go here worst customer service ever i dealt with minerva the worst there was an issue regarding my bill and damage done to the truck that was not by me and when i called to follow up each time i was yelled at and one time hung up on i eventually had to call the regional manager scott who avoided my phone calls until i called the main office the issue is being resolved now but this location has the worst customer service i have ever dealt with i think that because of the location they think that they can talk down to their customers what they dont understand is that not every one that comes in there is uneducated i am extremely amazed at how horrible my experience was never again never even using haul again avoid at all costs|0

actually i gave it a one star only because the food is fairly good too bad the owner treats her customers and employees in such a rude and disrespectful manner for the life of me i dont understand why anyone would want to work at this establishment the owner is totally clueless that its her customers who are responsible for her having a successful business she obviously doesnt care if she treats you rudely as she knows there are plenty of people who will accept such shoddy treatment if you want to spend your hard earned money on a business who really doesnt care if you patronize the place or not i say you get what you pay for|0

were yelping the tram ok ill bite during a recent weekend in vegas my husband and i stayed at the mandalay bay as such we on more than one occasion took advantage of the tram that brought us over to excalibur from there we could easily access new york new york cross over to the mom grand to pick up the monorail and boy was it heavy etc the tram was very convenient it always came within a few minutes and was generally uncrowded enough that we could snag a seat not that you really need one for such a short journey however that short journey was made to seem soooo much longer by the horrendous carrot top commercials we were subjected to along the way those im afraid cost the tram a star|1
aka we care professional moving company led not sure why the company has multiple names told i not good yelp wasnt available in canada when we hired this company so this is a delayed review i booked this company to move us from an apartment when we bought our house i called about 60 days in advance and was quoted hour he i believe it was the owner of the company assured me that they dont just hire random guys that he has a very careful fast staff with really good movers it sounded good he was a good salesman they were scheduled to arrive at am on our moving day moving day am comes and goes by 930am i called them and they had completely forgotten about our booking they were in fact moving someone else instead but promised they could come by in the afternoon once they were done with that move and all tired out once the movers finally showed up at 1 they said the rate was sehr i told them i had been quoted sehr but they insisted and because we were at that point stuck i had to frown and put up with the bait and switch i mean it was only an extra 30 or so but still their website claims they wrap everything not sure if that is currently true or not when they moved us they wrapped nothing everything was just haphazardly shoved onto the truck they dented our brand new deep freeze when the one mover carried it by himself down the stairs over his shoulder dented our stainless steel garbage can and the movers were totally random labourers im surprised more stuff wasnt wrecked but it wasnt a good experience very unhappy get any quote in writing before going ahead with this company i cant state that strongly enough also get in writing a contract of what happens should anything be damaged by the movers we had zero recourse for the stuff that was damaged highly recommend just going with one of the big companies like williams instead of these people|0

i wanna start by saying the dentist is a great man but the receptionist should not have her job i will avoid that place like a plague i gave a one star cos of the dentist i wont be surprised if they have low patient volume most definitely because she scares them away i just feel bad for the dentist otherwise it would have been zero star the receptionist does not follow instructions regardless of what you tell her you want she tries to get u to do something else and when you insist on getting what u asked for she tried to make u feel bad for it what kinda human being are you i only wanted a cleaning and i wanted to pay for it not use my insurance i clean my teeth 4 times a year but insurance only covers 2 i alternate it she insisted on using the insurance she got annoyed because i declined fluoride lady im breastfeeding obviously doesnt not care about the patient just money she forced an examination saying i couldnt clean my teeth unless the doc examines my teeth so i did the examination cleaned my teeth why did i com here you may ask my regular hygienist is out of town so i figure let me try this location its closer to my house wrong bargain and then on the way out the ma asked me if i was going to make my next appointment in front of everyone ok no im not coming back my husband tells me im too polite and normally i would have said yes and cancel it later but i was just so annoyed that i couldnt say yes i cant begin to imagine how many people have been taken advantage off by this woman i hope the dentist knows shes his biggest downfall let me know when you get rid of the money gouging rude receptionist i think liz is her name|0
i went in this space today and was appalled with the pricing as some items were quadrupled their value i shop interiors all over the world and i almost choked from laughter at the thought of poor suckers who believe they are getting any real value here one exception i saw one particular hand painted desk that i thought was fair a pair of nightstand were beyond ridiculous for what they were asking the sleepy poet has had similar for literally one tenth the price granted this store is parked close to myers park but this is not kings it charleston even in a good economy newsflash do these con signers know what is going on in this country if this store is open 6 months from now i will be shocked by the way i loved interiors marketplace when it was located at atherton mill much better prices quality and selection|0
its been a long time since my husband and i have been as impressed by restaurant food as we were during our visit here the food here is definitely the best indian food weve had the green chile appetizer is coated in a fried chickpea batter and covered in a thick layer of well flavored veggies it was truly amazing we also shared the kada i curry and were equally impressed i have a gluten allergy and it sounds as if most items are gluten free the servers are quite knowledgeable about the ingredients so its definitely a great option for people with gluten allergies i noticed that the gluten free lunch buffet items are labeled as such service was extremely friendly and fast the interior is also nicely decorated unfortunately we live in new mexico so we wont be able to come back anytime soon however this will be our go to place whenever we end up in madison|1

we took our grandmother here for a going away dinner before she moved to a different city sadly it was not what we came to expect from red lobster the air conditioner was cranked to the max and it was a chilly day to begin with so when our food finally arrived it was cold before we got to taste it we had ordered endless shrimp and after our first round of shrimp we waited for our waiter to return for over 15 minutes and after we ordered the second shrimp selection they didnt make it to our table for another 20 minutes and after the rest of us had finished our entire meals we then asked for the bill and when we finally got it the waiter didnt return to cash us out we actually had to walk to the front to pay we asked the manager to speak about our service and he told us to wait a moment and he would be right back but never returned service at its finest lol|0
oh bou stan the centrepiece of every drunk night out in the plateau or concord ghetto a montreal chain of lebanese late night fare falafel so warm a i aft kebab garlic potatoes pretty decent if your e hammered i just have one question why here why set up shop next to the most legendary middle eastern restaurant in all of montreal its like deciding to open up a golf course next to pebble beach or a concert venue next to carnegie hall sure it follows the starbucks strategy if an independent caf is thriving in area i chances are there are enough basic people for your caf to survive in area x000001 unfortunately bou stan misses the mark by about seven hundred miles watery garlic sauce burnt pita chicken that tastes like it did before farmers bred the species to taste like non dinosaur a marvellous gambit on part of the bou stan staff to try and pick up the neighbourhoods drunken sloppy seconds but then again thats all this restaurant is your e better off ordering another shawarma a week in advance letting it rot on your countertop and then digging in it will probably still taste better sorry bou stan|0

a group of buddies and i were in montreal for the weekend and we were getting pretty sick of poutine and bagels by the ord day we checked out a couple other korean places near our place but nothing met our standards i found hans ang was relatively close and funny enough right across the street from the poutine place we were getting tired of first impressions are highly important for me and trust me when i say this place did not disappoint very elegant and modern furnishing with a bit of traditional korean artwork and other decor splashed in to remind you that you arent here for a steak and wine dinner but some hearty korean goodness we came around a short while before they closed so the restaurant was more or less empty and came back the very next day for lunch before catching our trains back home both times were not busy at all the service was great except one friend who had a couple hiccups in service both times the food was more or less exactly what you i expect they also informed us they had a 10 discount for students which is nice the only real downside id say would be the prices are a tad high from what im used to but probably what you i normally expect if you live in montreal also their ban chan game is weak lol also it looked like they have public wifi but i couldnt be bothered to ask them for the password|1
the mother i locker was mother clucking no sauce just no sauce to tez no sauce the pirate was 12 way decent the price of 30 for some pizza that isnt too much of anything id a big let down for 10 more you can get 16 gigantic slices from se noises i thought id give them a chance its a leg up from pizza 73 but still disappointing|0
off is the worst run facility i have ever been to i have been a member of approximately 10 gyms in the ga i thought this place would get better after it changed from premier fitness but i was horribly mistaken the owner steve is a poor example of leadership and has no idea how to run a club most of the staff are also incompetent run far away|0

restaurant pizza solo cuisine pizza location financial district address 1 toronto street price range 10 1 poor 2 ok 3 good 4 very good 5 excellent food 4 service 2 ambiance 2 overall 35 extra information big portions big seating area delivery avail special any slice any drink for 530 tax if you ever walk around downtown toronto i guarantee you have passed by at least one pizza solo ive tried mamas pizza just around the corner and i really did not enjoy it so i was a little he distant to try this place this place cant be missed with its bright green store sign and once you walk in its very clean and bright inside the restaurant there were 2 people working behind the counter one girl at the cashier and and a guy in the kitchen area i never expect spectacular service at pizza joints like this but its always nice when someone greets and acknowledges you are there obviously that didnt happen here and my family was the only people there but i guess i shouldnt complain when i am paying 3 for a slice of pizza ordered canadian o i paid 530tax for this which includes this giant slice plus a drink its so big they cut it for you in half there are lots of options catering to meat lovers vegetarians and whatever suits you they heat this up for you when you make your choice but it doesnt take very long i really enjoyed this ordered chicken pesto this was my moms choice and i took a bite of it this was also very good but kind of dry i think it would taste good with some ranch sauce on top or hot sauce summary i love this place and its worth every penny|1

this restaurant has gone downhill over the last few years we both ordered a platter and had to order a drink separately why the place is filthy the floors are in need of a good scrubbing and the ladies room is gross the order take was more concerned with moving people along than with service or quality of food my chicken was so greasy that it soaked at least ten napkins i used to love coming here for dinner but i think i will now go elsewhere not worth the money even though its not that expensive definitely a thumbs down|0
a little bit disappointed with this place i came yesterday with a great mood because we had an unusual weather in cleveland i ordered in and out cleaning and that costed around 22 wow id thought that i found a cheap place however i left dissatisfied and with the dirty inside i do not exactly what they mean by saying an inside cleaning i expect that dust will be cleaned some stains removed and a vacuum will be done well these are mine expectations when i think about the inside cars cleaning so i did not get it actually i asked a service guy to come to recheck my car because inside looked untouched even after second inspection i was displeased with the inside cleaning plus the car was not washed well for example i was going to another place in beechwood where i paid for in and out cleaning 36 and they usually did very good job i thought that may be i would discover a new place for my car cleaning but i wont be back to this place sorry|0

home inspection seekers beware of working with fred roach my roach conducted a home inspection on my good friends property while their family was on vacation during the summer the inspection had no issues but my roach accidentally left their ac unit on 99 degrees they came home after a week and the house was an oven food was liquified make up was ruined and it took over six hours to cool the house unfortunately due to the heat over 550 dollars worth of wine was ruined my roach was contacted professionally regarding this issue although they provided key logs and evidence proving that he was without a doubt the only person who operated their ac unit he claimed he was not responsible my roach went as far as suggesting that they were lying they never had wine it was their fault that they did not have a wine cooler and that he simply didnt do it he has flagrantly ignored the facts and refused to take responsibility in their last correspondence he stated that he would settle for 200 but he has been difficult and awful to deal with as a professional he has insulted them refused to cooperate and overall been a very unpleasant person to deal with when this should have been an easy matter to mitigate|0
the doctors are good and friendly however im never seen by the same doctor my son been a patient there for 6 years and hes not recognized by anyone in the office this bothers me the ladies at the desk are extremely rude every single time as if im thoughtlessly wasting their time with my selfish need to check in my sick child so many times ive wanted to grab my little boy and walk out as if a parent with a sick child isnt anxious and stressed enough they have to now deal with your rude snarky non friendly staff honestly doctors please stop allowing your employees to treat your patients this way its a very consistent problem in that office|0
i called pink plumbing because of its great reviews i had a hot water line leaking issue on sunday called pink plumbing on monday and scheduled an appointment for tuesday but in the meantime the owner chris was kind enough to spend some time with me over the phone and taught me how to shut off the hot waterline from the water heater to stop it from running then i got a call mid morning on monday from the technician chris stating that he would be able to fit me in within an hour chris showed up before i was able to get home diagnosed the issue and provided an estimate and called me within an hour to schedule a time for the leak locating service to come at the same time the next day to complete the repair the next day tuesday both chris es owner and technician showed up on time met the leak locating service located the leak and rerouted my hot water line chris also recommended a new hot water heater replacement since mine is 19 years old and it was installed today wednesday i want to say thank you so much to chris the owner and chris the technician for their promptness courteous and exceptional services because of both chris es i was able to minimize any possible water damage to my house but most importantly put my mind at ease they were also very accommodating with my work schedule it is very stressful when you have water issue at the house and i am so glad i called pink plumbing because they really do care|1

great customer service we were 300 miles from home around 440 saturday the tire pressure low light comes on i did a search for repair shop in downtown cleveland the only place open was firestone i pull in at 500 am and by 545 we were on our way to tour the rock and roll hall of fame we had to replace a tire didnt want to drive 3 hours home on the donut spare want to give a shout out to amy my service advisor and jason the technician thanks again|1
called to find out the price for repair and was told that i am lazy that i should drive it in for the owner to see when i said i just wanted to know how much the owner called me bitch and hung up on me totally shocked at this ever wonder how these places get away with rudeness hope this review helps others do not take your clothes here|0
short version i cant believe this place is still in business given that star walk buffet is just him down the road the difference in quantity and quality between the two places is absolutely immense long version the only premium foods that mandarin has that star walk does not have are prime rib low quality and crab legs the premium foods that star walk has that mandarin does not have are sashimi mandarin has a sashimi nazi that will give you a plate with 23 on it at a time lobster crispy skin roast pig peking duck the reason this comparison is important is that the non premium foods are insufficient to justify the 27 price if you go to a 27 buffet to just eat fried rice and sweet and sour pork your e an idiot the demographics of the clientele is also very telling star walk has about 95 asian clientele mandarin has about 60 asian clientele why is this difference important if you walked into a mexican restaurant in an area with a huge mexican population and almost half the clientele are gringos what would your conclusion be what if the mexican restaurant down the street had only 5 gringos so unless your sole goal of going to a buffet is to eat as much crab legs as possible go to the one 10 minutes down the street youll thank me for it|0
we were staying in scottsdale so i thought the 20 min drive out to fountain hills wouldnt be bad to check out the fountain and let the kids play on the playground we were really disappointed to find out that the fountain doesnt operate when winds reach lymph all we saw was a fountain base with no water book on top of that the playground equipment was really hot in the afternoon sun so my daughter couldnt even play on it this park isnt bad but there really is nothing else to do around the park if the fountain isnt operating just remember to check the wind forecast|0
im so beyond disgusted with the incompetence and just outright rudeness shared by every single person ive dealt with at this dealership other than one nice lady with great hair way yay y too many issues with this place i cant even begin to get them all down here because im so furious and want our truck back heres a just a few examples of their lack of anything remotely related to customer appreciation or satisfaction first visit there came to pick the truck back up after a ridiculous amount of time to find a nice new dent in the door eventually after belittling me and basically insinuating i was a liar they paid to have it repaired transmission issues never ever get repaired properly we have an extended warranty that they can never seem to find theyve kept our truck for three weeks for a repair that was booked and after repeated calling finally told me ohhs ya we lost the keys so ya it didnt even get looked at the extremely rude younger ish girl at the service counter with the personality of a rock well i wont even get into that because she makes me want to vomit there is a complete lack of any sort of value placed on the customer or their vehicle at woodridge ford and im ashamed to have gone back over and over and over in hopes that something would change never ever ever again|0
funny my thoughts a but this store is totally different i find the staff totally pretentious not a very friendly place the store is so stuffed it is hard to move around in my pet peeve is to be given a different size then you ask for the staff assume that you dont anything about buying a pair of jeans buying a new pair of jeans is hard enough to be given a pair too small because the staff know better i also agree with other reviews dresses seem to be of poor quality this store is not on my list for jeans|0
stopped in for the first time today and had a wonderful experience was greeted right when i walked in then i was give a tour of the different types of cuts and informed on the packages and items on sale they have an amazing selection from beef chicken to all sorts of bison cuts they even have bison hot dogs and bacon which i cant wait to try i will definitely be buying my meat here from now on|1
this used to be one of my favorite places to come but not no more they raised there prices and the service went down hill here is the other thing you have to watch out for when you put your name down on the list people will walk in and just sit down at seats that are available the tall spanish guy there who sits you down is a jackass and is rude my wife saved him from being punch in the face just a warning to you guys thanks|0

my husband and i wont have anyone else touch are cars but kirk and his crew a few years ago i had an ignition switch issue with my 2003 gunfire at the time we had no idea thats what it was my husband and i must of called 2 or 3 other mechanics and none of them could figure it out kirk figured it out he saved my cars life this is a busy gang age and patience is a must i think its great that you can ask for a rental not expensive at all have them come pick you up and when your car is ready the rental guys drive you back when you drop off the rental the only disappointing thing in our family is that hubby cant watch his show on cable 10 mississauga because were in etobicoke oh well thanks brad and margaret|1

i dont like her at all shes real confrontational and does not care if something is bothering you whatsoever if you tell her something thats bothering you shell blink at you once say one sentence then move on the appointment lasts for all of 5 minutes she takes your blood pressure with a wrist cuff that she makes you place near your heart so it will register she then weighs you on a scale she bought from walmart she writes a few things down in her notes gives a re i only 2 refills then sends you on your way she doesnt even bother to make an appointment in advance three months later so you can get your meds refilled on time she does things the old fashioned way as in paper scripts that you have to physically take to the pharmacist old school pencil appointment books etc absolutely nothing is done electronically as with most medical offices having to call in a re refill is quite the fiasco since you have to leave her the pharmacy phone and location evidently she cant or wont look it up on google if the wrong is accidentally given your day what medication you need the dosage amount etc doesnt she have record of that the answer is yes but she cant be bothered to look it up she is a bit difficult to get in touch with she also charges my prices when shes just a nurse practitioner|0
i hate coming to this store they dont greet and it takes for ever for someone to wait on you no stars at all they only get this one be you cant move on with the post without rating this will be my last time coming|0
winter vicious 2016 double garlic caesar yucca al for no array mini welly county dark lamb shank en arouse southern comfort redux brown butter and bourbon cannoli dark chocolate coffee and salted caramel pudding parfait overall very good food apps were a good start to the meal lamb was very nicely cooked good mix of flavors the fried chicken had a nice kick and the jala peo corn bread was tasty the pudding parfait was heavy and rich be warned save space and cannoli was the lighter but equally good dessert service was 20 worthy included great recommendations|1
the only thing this place has going for it are the portion sizes but if the food is gross than you dont really want a lot of it had the mixed burrito with chicken very little flavor got it wet and the enchilada sauce tasted like tomato sauce no flavor doesnt come with chips or anything 10 minutes after eating about half i have a terrible stomach ache and have already run to the bathroom twice i do not recommend|0
great food the staff is good i love the chicken and pork soup 16 one of those hidden gems thats great to go and seek out|1
horrible service went into the store and ordered the dishwasher at to he kiosk just to find out i could not have the unit that was in my hands online orders have to wait til next day the system would not take my address the manager asked if he could use the store address i asked if he could just honor the online price he said he would if the store address didnt work sure enough the store address worked i had to drive 60 miles again because they couldnt process the order until tomorrow why not use customer service and honor online price to boot the manager is an idiot he was going to let me make another trip back for an install kit good thing i went through the accessories to see what was missing then the dumb manager was like oh you need the install kit shouldnt the idiot have mentioned this while buying the unit rather than me doing an inventory to see what it was missing this guy could probably screw up sweeping a floor and probably couldnt figure out how to succeed on unemployment i told him that i wasnt buying his crap and would get it from home depot this is the manager who worked at 8 am on jan 17 and 1 am on jan 18 totally not centered on customer service should be fired you have my receipt on file number 941552212 and know who i am please feel free to call|0
we work in the area so we decided to venture out of our usual preferences and try something new should have just stuck with our usual go to i ordered the laka noodles which which was 1094 and my husband the sweet and sour pork with veggies and a pepsi which was 1395 we ordered this stuff to go and i was completely shocked that everything we ordered fit in 3 little containers my laka was in a small white foam container with the soup noodle and toppings crammed in which you can probably imagine the portion was extremely small how in the world do you cram noodles with soup with toppings in a small foam container and my husbands sweet and sour pork he 2 extra small containers one which consisted of 4 small pieces of pork and another soupy container of overly salty stir fried veggies for 23 this is pricey and on top of that the portions were ridiculously small they may as well be robbing people for their money im guessing the portions would be a little bigger if you were to eat there be i can not imagine an extra small bowl of laka being served in the resto for 1094 none the less the food was crap extremely over priced and on top of that we spent 20 mins sitting there waiting for the food to be ready would not recommend save your money and time|0
waited 20 minutes no food asked for refund clueless front counter guy couldnt connect the problem 3 others got refunds two people in line were told the situation and left|0
this by far is the worst ran business ive ever encountered first ill start by saying if your e going in to purchase a few items forget it theyll have two registers open for dozens of customers meaning be prepared to spend half a day just paying for your items theyll have two registers open while having dozens of employees walking around also they close at 830 and i once showed up right at 830 and they turned me away at the door with an attitude i live within a couple miles of this place and i deliberately drive to another location to avoid the horrendous customer service and shopping experience that this place serves on a cold dish please take your money down the street to coco this place obviously is not in business with customer service in mind|0
very rude front office dishonest and unethical provider please do your research and follow your gut i wish i would have there were several red flags i would never recommend this place youve been warned|0
my wife and i have been going to mexican restaurants for over 30 years in the valley this is hands down the best one we have ever been to this is not your standard mexican restaurant and is not a fast food restaurant the food is prepared and offered to you like any high end restaurant some of the best seafood recipes we have ever had you will not be disappointed|1
you know why i pay extra for glasses here instead of the internet because of the service employees are always professional and willing to give you all the advice you need when making a selection my glasses were scratched when i bought them and they did a great job at getting me a replacement pair as quickly as possible really like that type of service even though i have to pay extra for it|1

walked in on sunday late afternoon hoping for a tasty meal what we got instead was a waiter who disappeared often and a hostess who hovered and made awkward conversation seemingly performing no other duties their prices are high and i was not impressed with the menu or the flavor combos they have sodas made in house also disappointing the most redeeming details of our meal at market were my husbands beer made elsewhere and the outdoor patio i made a huge mistake|0
brittany who is exceptionally charming gave my the best haircut of my life after seeing her i would not let anyone else touch my mop for as long as i live in the state that she is working in her attention to detail is unparalleled and the cut she gave me is impeccable i could not be happier with the result nor the price leaving the salon i felt like i stole something i paid more than double that price for less than half of that service while living in la five stars|1
great ambiance food service i had the stuffed plantain appetizer the jerk tofu the bread pudding my friend had the stuffed chicken breast both of us loved the food the stuffed plantain was a great combination of salty and sweet the jerk tofu was spicy enough the vegetables were delicious the rice and peas was perfect the bread pudding was to die for food took a while to come but everything tasted so fresh that it was worth it also the wait staff checked in with us regularly to give us updates on the food and to refill our beverages so it was a pleasant wait the chef came to speak to us during our meal to ask if everything was to our satisfaction the ambiance is really nice the music old reggae motown was nice and not too loud the art and decor was welcoming the restaurant had a really nice vibe a charming slight upscale caribbean restaurant highly recommend it|1
this place is unsanitary beyond belief dont get me wrong the foods half bad but the cleanliness of the place is what really made my stomach que eye i spent one hour in there and within that time i saw food being taken from the dining room back behind the line to add sour cream for instance this is a big time health code violation not only that but i was sitting at the table eating and one of the waitresses came by and picked up my used napkin and placed it on the floor to clean up a mess i get it your e authoring authentic mexican food but you still need to follow american health and safety standards|0
small cafe in the omni hotel breakfast is good and the setting pleasant and bright menu is focused but covers a number of dishes i did not see gluten free but did not ask the kitchen was accommodating so they may have options fruit was in abundance and of course baked goods the eggs where cooked very runny for sunny side i like this you might mention your taste if a bit more heat is needed i think possibly a salmon dish was ahead of mine the eggs had a faint fish taste not bad but subtle bacon was perfect potatoes a bit dry home style i went with french toast was very good pro tip order off the menu buffet is just ok and cost is higher being from texas i asked for ice tea un sweet montreal does not usually offer this it has to be made opus made it up fresh and it was spot on was an enjoyable breakfast|1
awesome place to eat for sure near the strip and easy to spot 2 side dish combo 1 side dish combo tilapia for about 20 the food was fresh and delicious as good as real home cooking they provide vinegar fish sauces and other hot sauces they give you a lot of food for the combo meal and free tino la soup and during the meal the owner gave us free samples of fried chicken skin free tac channel and water def good places to eat if you want to eat good food and save some money i would go again if im in vegas|1
this salon is a joke just left there after an all over color and my hair felt dry and terrible after the shampoo no conditioner was applied to my long hair and it was towel dried and then the stylist tried to rip a wide tooth comb through my hair i asked her for some kind of a conditioner before she tried to comb my hair out which she did add but once i got home i found hair color in my ears and still sitting in the back of my hair near my neck i tried to call a manager from the salon but they must have closed 12 early because no one answered the phone or even returned my call i will never go back again and i suggest you dont either|0

we came here for lunch expecting it to be awesome because it was pretty busy with lots of professionals eating under the sun but the food is abysmal to say the least i ordered the table dot e and was pretty excited for my dishes to arrive i decided to go for the watermelon gazpacho which was just ok for someone who loves watermelon beyond words i could eat a whole melon in a day and forego any other food if you gave me the chance i couldnt contain my excitement when my dish arrived but seeing a pool of pink with a nice huge drop of oil swimming in the middle was pretty unappetizing nonetheless i assumed that it would be an awesome dish because well you cant really mess up anything with watermelon but i was sadly mistaken this was simply some blended and strained watermelon nearly flavour less with a tablespoon of unnecessary oil in the middle of it that didnt really serve to enhance the flavor and so i didnt finish the dish and started getting nervous for my main the main was a chicken breast salad which i was also looking forward to however i think its safe to say that this is the worst salad ive ever had sorry for the dramatic nature of this post so far but really the worst first of all its just chicken on lettuce no other vegetables but ok i can look past that a well cooked piece of chicken with vinaigrette will be good with good lettuce so lets break it down 1 the chicken was freezing cold im not talking about not warm because i dont expect warm chicken on my salads but i mean right out of the top shelf of the fridge freezing cold 2 this freezing piece of chicken was undercooked as several pieces from the middle of the breast were pink or nearly red in color 3 add to this the fact that the lettuce mix wasnt really fresh and ba ummm youve got the worst salad on earth the only good part of the table dot e our entire experience and the reason for the 2 instead of 1 stars was the amazing dessert which was a super intensely rich fudge brownie service was about a 510 with our waitress unable to speak a full english sentence and the food coming out pretty slowly the bread basket also never came out till we asked mid appetizer but that might be a money saving thing in any case dont waste your time or money here really not worth it unless your e coming for some wine and that awesome brownie or several servings of it obvi i|0
this was my first visit and the food service and atmosphere are amazing hefty portions with great prices guacamole is amazing ill be back for sure love it|1
very disappointing experiences here i gave them more then one try a couple trips ago they told us oh and the dogs heart murmur is doing fine just as same as last time when the last time they never even said anything about my dog having a heart murmur we had no idea then one morning i decided to do a walk in right when they opened because my dog wasnt acting like himself just so you know they give you a quote with a price of all the test they want to do and how much that is going to cost and ask for a signature before they even consider talking over what could be wrong etc that doesnt seem to me like they have my dogs best interest more like moneys best interest but i can may be understand why they would do that so i didnt mind however i didnt even know how i was going to afford the 6 test he wanted to do now i know that doctor lewis did the test in a certain order so that we didnt get an answer as to what was wrong until he had done all the rest i really have a strong feeling that the doctor did this on purpose after we found out what was wrong the doctor decided my dog needs to stay in the hospital for 35 days minimum and get all these expensive medications etc it all wouldve costed me 5000 i tell him that i really cant do that its impossible for me so i asked him what else we could do if there was an alternative he said yeah i guess we can give him a couple shots and a special food and send him home oh really but of course that wouldnt be the first thing you say im just a young girl who wants her dog to feel better and he just had to try to take advantage of that i know your e trying to make a living but come on assess the situation and may be have some empathy not to mention the doctor did not even come back in the room after i said i couldnt pay for that he didnt even come back he just sent his nurse or assistant or whatever that really showed me what was important to him and what his intentions were lastly the girls in the front are to be frank stupid for a number of reasons so i would just not at all recommend this place because it is an all around bad business as a whole|0
thank you matt for everything you did to make our event a great success wonderful working with you and the food was amazing|1

when i first phoned in the receptionist said they were very busy and i had to book over 2 weeks in advance to get my boyfriend and i in the day before my appointment i got a phone call saying the nurse was sick so i had to reschedule apparently they only have one nurse so i was booked for the next friday another week i then got a phone call saying the doctor was not in on friday so i had to reschedule again for the next monday we got there 15 minutes late on monday couldnt find the place and the receptionist said she didnt have my boyfriends info which i was never asked for but because she didnt have his info and we were a little late they wouldnt help us and said we had to re book i have to add the place was deserted and when i had phoned 20 minutes earlier for directions no one answered quality but if you can actually get in to see a doctor im sure they are great|0
worst attorney ever do not hire my friend used this attorney for his divorce and she drained him financially and basically lost his case she files unnecessary paperwork makes tons of phone calls and sends a barrage of emails and charges for each and every one instead of gathering all documents and sending all at one time shell send it in 5 different emails just to fill her pockets her court room delivery is a joke her skills are lacking and it seemed as though the judge was mocking her for her lack of law knowledge sheer idiot is what comes to mind when dealing with nancy khi el spare yourself money and a headache and go elsewhere this woman is a horrible attorney if i could do a no star review i would have|0
i attended the mandatory intro session visit and was not too impressed the facilities seem to be ok but the staff owner seem a bit too militant for my liking i was be rated for having my dog fixed which i was lectured on getting the traditional shots for my dog they dont think it is necessary and add some type of additive to the dog water to prevent illness feeding him commercial dog food apparently i should be feeding him raw meat only was again lectured on the length of my dogs nails he had just had them clipped at outsmart the weekend before and the overall i health and wellbeing of my dog he got a clean bill of health at the vets office two weeks before i get that they are dog people but just as i hated people telling me what to do and lecturing me when my kids were babies i dont appreciate it with the dog the application form was larger and more detailed then the one i was required to fill out for my kids daycare they will also make you sign a waiver that allows them to clip your dogs nails feed them their expensive food and provide other treatment that they deem necessary then charge you for it when you return to pick up your dog i go by the advice of my vet who sucessfully completed years of training not a dog trainer with no formal qualifications in short the attitudes scared me off if you are the kind of person that treats their pet like a surrogate child then this is place for you if you are a regular person and treat your dog like a dog then you may want to save yourself the lectures|0

this place deserves no stars at all there should be an option where you can rate it with no stars worst place ever from the minute you walk in there was no welcome just a evil and rude what can i do for you asking questions so rudely and making you feel unwelcome i went here only because the place i scheduled my appointment with cancelled on me last min and i wanted to treat my mom and sisters to a girls day out for mother day there were 5 of us not one of us wanted to be there any longer i showed this lady who seemed to be the owner if not their commander a picture of the type of nail i wanted and she immediately said itll be about 20 or mins i was fine with waiting but my mom and sisters urged that we leave so as we waiting i was scrolling yelp and this place popped up since i was trying to see if there was anywhere closer that might take us in less than mins and then so happened beauty nails popped up well what do you know it had the poorest of poor reviews and some customers were stating the same thing i experienced guys that was the final straw i stood up and told her its okay we booked an appointment somewhere else yeah right no way in hell am i paying the bride of chucky to do my nails and end up having it chipped and in that case why would you do business with someone so rude although the workers all clearly can speak english since we can hear them talk yet they still make remarks in their language and start laughing well what in the hell please save yourselves the trouble ladies i would not bring my business here suh|0

i wanted to like this place it looked like it had great ambiance from outside and i love korean food however the service was slow and unfriendly that was one server the other server was nice but she didnt seem to know the wine menu very well and had to tell me multiple times after checking that they were out of the wine i ordered the ambiance wouldve been nice but damn they need some acoustic damping i could barely hear my friend and she was sitting just across from me we had to talk quite loudly finally the spicy pork buns were excellent the mushroom salad was mediocre given the price expensive i was expecting it to be a lot better but i feel like ive had just as good korean food if not better in koreatown and with much better service at 13 the price needs work|0

keep driving go elsewhere we purchased a certified 2013 450gl the car is fine its a mercedes find another dealer though the salesperson description of the warranty has been wrong now twice in addition the salesman assured us that all four tires were brand new after 8 thousand miles the back tires are shot and the front ones have less than one thousand miles of tred left a close look at the paperwork reveals that only the back tires were labeled new even then the service manager asserts that new doesnt mean they were actually new she also asserts that cars go through tires in 8 thousand miles thats not my problem excuse me this is the level of service i received in my younger years when i bought cars from used car dealers so dont even pull into the dealership find another they are out there is looking at the other six yelp reviews i see all with 5 stars really im wondering now about yelps integrity|0

first of all i should point out that i have experienced worse veterinarians than these the admin and assisting staff at this location seem to genuinely love all the animals and the grooming services were great i think that if my dog had been a simple occasional check up sort of case this place would have been sufficient so i visited this vet with my dog starting a little over a year ago when i moved into a condo nearby my dog was old at the time 13 years and had been having a little trouble with incontinence for a while they recommended a number of tests for her which were pricey but arent they all that eventually showed that she had cushing disease they told us the treatment option for this was a drug that cost 250 month for her breed which we could not afford when i asked if there were other options i was told no when i explained at first obtuse ly then eventually very bluntly that we simply would not be able to afford that option i asked what would happen moving forward in one of the most surreal conversations of my life they kept telling me about the option i had turned down as if i hadnt understood this happened three or four times to finish the story i felt very alienated so i visited a vet 3 hours away who was a friend of the family she said the incontinence could be temporarily cured with an inexpensive drug and then compassionately explained what would be happening to my dog when her cushing went untreated she explained both when we would know we had to euthanize her later and that we were being reasonable in not treating our elderly dog when we didnt have the money its too bad the market lane animal hospital didnt provide the same information and support closer to home|0

well id first like to start off by saying that this school is the most hype school in arizona but there are few negatives such as some of the faculty are very rude to the students and think they are always right and then some of the faculty is nice and they will listen to your opinion on the topic you are discussing the other negatives are that some people think that having a political opinion is wrong and will bash you on it on twitter the other negative is the cafeteria management it is very poor no sense of urgency whats so ever now the positives desert mountain is a great school with a great atmosphere the student section is at every home game and cheering on the wolves every time and they promote every sport at desert mountain overall this school is one of the best high schools in arizona i do a|1
awesome barber shop experience i am very picky when it comes to my hair and have had the same barber for about the last 24 years due to work i was unable to get into his shop before i left town for my vegas vacation so my dilemma was how i was going to have a fresh cut this week i settled on the brotherhood barber shop because it was close to onlv and figured they probably had a lot of experience cutting i must say i was impressed the shop is small with not much of a waiting area i was a walk in so expected to be waiting a long time surprisingly one barber male ek i hope i spelled his name right had a opening quickly he was about to actually leave the shop but he said he would take care of me this shop has lots of personality and humor all the barbers were friendly and engaging they recommend a few spots to go to for celebrating me birthday the right way i got a shadow fade and it came out just right it was a good call to get me through the week back at home i am used to paying 35 before a tip here it was 30|1

the service is extremely slow i ordered 3 dishes with my friends and the first one came after being seated for an hour the dishes also came 45 minutes apart so no one even ate at the same time the wait staff was extremely unhelpful and unfriendly they stood in the corner talking instead of doing anything productive needless we were all extremely unsatisfied and will not be back soon i would give it lower than 1 star if possible|0
the other reviews are spot on this place has zero customer service i was in on a weekday morning and counted 5 sales people working not a single one of them said hello or offered any assistance i gathered a pile of clothes to try and again no one offered to start a dressing room the dressing rooms are like a ghost town no one there to help or offer other sizes checkout woman was unfriendly and these are not young snotty girls but middle aged women that should have better social skills i will definitely not be back i like loft clothes but i would rather drive to a different location that appreciates their customers|0
bad experience but eventually got it worked out it took them 3 days to just look and write up an estimate for my vehicle then they said it would be fixed at the end of that week when that day came they said something happened and that they needed another part and that it would be next week when that day came something else apparently and that it would be later the second week when that day came when they were supposedly cleaning up my car for delivery they noticed something wrong that was pointed out when i initially dropped the vehicle off after finally getting my vehicle back after 3 extensions later they still managed to mess up my car my battery was just about dead from sitting for 3 weeks they managed to put my windshield washer nozzles on backwards so they dont even spray my windshield i found interior panels off my vehicle for some reason even though i did not have any repairs made my headlight they replaced did not get aimed and does not project properly the grille on my hood was left loose all the bolts that hold it on were started but never tightened down they over filled my coolant tank this is all that i have found so far they will also tell you they want to make sure everything is okay with your vehicle before returning it to you when its not finished 100 times update after returning for the fixes on my vehicle the manager was very helpful and took care of all the fixes my vehicle needed i wish my vehicle had this attention at first but they made sure i was satisfied with everything before i left the manager was very helpful in handling my one off case second update found bolts for safety crash tubes not screwed in all the way major safety concern also have had alignment check done elsewhere and found that they did not fix or perform an alignment on my vehicle unacceptable|0
long delayed review here clearly there is no shortage of frozen yogurt places but its hard to find one that with the right mix in i ryo consistency and taste of course its a personal preference and my pick in az is zen zen since i can also get my shaved ice fix here im a big fan of anything taro so i was stoked they had it available the day we went part of the fun of eating i ryo is the surprise of what flavors you end up with on the day that you visit regardless of where your favorite place is i also love i ryo places that have seasonal favorites and zen zen has that covered too being that im one of the blessed few who cant handle too much dairy im grateful they carry multiple non dairy flavors from what i recall i think they carry sugar free options as well for those of you that care side note they keep this place clean which is always a plus anyways if your e around this area stop by try it out and youll be greeted by quality service its always great to see staff taking pride in what they love and what they do would love a zen zen yogurt in california|1
the only reason why this gets a 4 instead of a 5 is because they can frequently run out of product and the selection can be slim other than that their prepared food and their meat cuts are always top quality what a urban gem the fact that they frequently run out can be a good thing because you know when they have what your e looking for its going to be very fresh|1
best addition to the north las vegas area the spa itself is beautiful and the lounge chairs are extremely comfy chelsea did an amazing job on both explaining what she would do with my eyebrows and in shaping and micro blading shading them i also inquired about doing lashes and expressed my concern about sensitivity to the adhesive and chelsea was kind enough to do a test on my lashes so we could check for any problems i cant wait to return in the beginning of september for chelsea to do the mermaid lashes for my vacation|1

this is my favorite place to come chill out after a week of work i always come here on a weekday less people more chill this is strictly just hookah no drinks or alcohol however there is a 711 right down the street for those of you who need it they show movies on monday nights and fuku burger is outside their doors on tuesdays i always takes care of us and gives us great suggestions on what to try next if your e going to come here to party this isnt the right place for you the lounge area is small and although they have great music i wouldnt suggest getting up and dancing the bathroom needs a lot of work bring your own hand sanitizer youll thank me later but besides that its a nice place|1
during a very unfortunate time in my family i life i came across this place through yelp when we spoke on the phone the man was very helpful made the process easy was very kind and respectful they closed at 12 on this particular day but he was there with us well after 1 prices are also reasonable they provided information about funding the hospital provides to assist with end of life costs for children that the hospital didnt even mention to us thank you very much|1
we used to get pizza somewhere else for work but heard so much great stories about this place that we had to order it from here it was the last day of the the month and it is the most stressful day for everyone so to make matters less stressful our bosses ordered pizzas for us it was the best pizza place around the area we ordered a few supremes tacos and plan pepperoni very generous on the toppings perfect sauce and the crust was just right the actual meat of the bread was soft and the bottom wasnt like cardboard rock hard nice slice of pizza to take a bite from only reason im giving it a 4 is because i havent been there to eat so next time im going in to try|1

amy was unable to do a quality job altering front darts for a prom dress what is most bothersome is she seemed to be okay with completely crooked and bunched up seams for the front darts twice i had to ask her to try and fix it at first it honestly looked like a 5 year old attempted the alterations her attempts were unsuccessful as she only wanted to bunch the fabric and not cut it so that it would lay flat she said the fabric was chiffon and too difficult to work with yet still charged me 35 for un presentable alterations|0

came here today when my flu symptoms starting causing a major problem with my chest i was quickly taken in and barely waited 10 minutes between signing patient forms and seeing my caretaker although i loved my physician i was curious as to why she was a pa versus a regular my however she knew what she was doing and confirmed that i had bronchitis she made sure she did a thorough examination xray and all and made sure i was comfortable at all times within 30 minutes i was outside ready to collect my prescriptions overall this is a great place to go if you dont have a regular pop here esp if your e a student and your e not fond of health services at your university and you want a thorough checkup the only con about here is that they dont take all insurances like mine blue cross blue shield but do offer a self pay option which is a flat fee of 115|1

i have been training under coach istvan dios beg i for a little over 3 years now when i first committed to the sport after coming out of crossfit i had all the desire to learn the lifts but little strength and none of the technique despite this i was treated with all the respect and patience a good coach affords an athlete who genuinely wants to learn in all this time i gained a tremendous appreciation for the sport along with more strength better technique and more self confidence i have found the perfect fit for my need for discipline in my athletic life and a controlled outlet for aggression that is just my story olympia weightlifting club is composed of athletes of various backgrounds skill levels ages and goals istvan coaches us all and understands each of our intrinsic and extrinsic motivators he works with each athlete competitor or not to help them achieve their goals there is no need to be intimidated by the sport we all started somewhere|1

i enjoy visiting a gram garden centre both to look at the nursery stock for ideas and to purchase trees shrubs and perennials the selection is diverse and i have purchased a number of plants that i could not find anywhere else in the ga prices are competitive and the 40 off sale at the end of the summer is much appreciated an older lady who i think is a master gardener orders many new and interesting plants each year such as the marion jarvis peach which is so difficult to come by a grams conifer selection is excellent of the dozens of shrubs and trees that i have bought there in the past few years only 1 didnt survive this was returned with no hassles if planted properly in the correct soil and light conditions as well as being watered well the first couple of years your plants will survive i find the staff very knowledgeable and helpful|1
oh mirage you complete me well almost my husband and i usually go to vegas a couple times a year and last year the mirage was one of two hotel we stayed at on the strip we got a tower deluxe room with a view of the strip all i can say is yes yes yes the tower deluxe rooms have keyed private elevators that take you directly to the upper rooms this is really nice since the hotels regular elevators constantly have a wait the to rooms boast a upgraded bathroom that includes marble double sinks jetted tub and separate shower the travel shampoo shower gel lotion are all from mirages spa and the sink area also has a nice lighted magnifying mirror additionally there is a huge full size mirror outside the bathroom door so you can get a view of of of you the bedroom area had a king size bed with a fluffy comforter it has nice closets on each side of the bed complete with robes there are also nightstand on each side with a safe and a ipod dock alarm clock over by the window is the desk and on the opposite wall of the bed is a nice sized flat screen i have to note too that the mirage volcano is a must see at least once when in vegas it is free and happens every 15 minutes in the evening it is a spectacular show of fire balls dancing to drum beats and lava erupting to the music it was designed by the same people who did the fellatio fountains their pool area is a series of pools and waterfalls and has a nice resort feel too it they also have the secret garden near the pool where you can see do oh ins and the white tigers for a fee of course my only gripe with mirage is the food on site while i do like to hit some nice restaurants while in sin city i need fast food from time to time the mirage just doesnt have it there is a deli onsite that is quite good but my turkey sandwich set me back 15 so if you want fast food you are out of lunch at the mirage still it was one of my best vegas experiences no real complaints i give it 45 stars|1
not that bad but very small and relatively boring especially if you are used to big clubs this place is not that great|0

how is it possible that a restaurant can keep exceeding my expectations every time we went with a huge group on saturday night and it was fab i love that the hosts at the door are always very happy to see you the food is delicious the menu has their the old i ios favourites like the huge meatball that my friend jane dreams about the grilled calamari that i dream out the specials are usually planned and thought out oh and delicious the servers are after my own heart not snobby very attentive knowledgeable and take demanding foodie friends in stride water always full or decanter on the table check side plates for appetizers check new cutlery after the appetizer check it might be worth noting that they have expanded the restaurant there used to be an autoshop next door that they now use for large parties i was loud and fun the only time that you will pay through the nose is if you dont watch how many bottle of wine are flying around|1
the guy that was minding the store on the morning of 20170912 is a total asshole no smile no greeting no thank you for my purchase short haired idiot that hasnt a clue about what customer service is i have been in this store before when the same guy has been there and he has been an asshole every time all the other guys i have dealt with here have been very nice i dont like feeling like a damn cashier is doing me a favor by taking my money when the fact that i spend my money there pays his salary which he obviously doesnt deserve who ever the manager is or the owner of the store needs to teach him what customer service is may be ill just go to tops down the street where everyone is very friendly|0

avoid avoid avoid lost a repeat customer ordered cards from them 4 or 5 years ago they came out okay the spot uv was a bit blotchy and slightly off but they were okay in retrospect i remember those cards arriving late but i figured after so many years they must have improved right decided to get new cards so i put an order in with them for some very nice cards about 400 for 1000 told them i needed it by the with assured me i would probably get it by then with standard shipping but i would be better off if i paid an extra 70 bucks for expedited shipping asked to cancel the order at this time but they told me i would be charged a 25 fee 100 for nothing agreed to add the extra shipping after all i really didnt have a choice which brings the cost of the cards to almost 500 since they assured me in would receive the cards by aug with the rep i talked to said she would keep an eye on my order and let me know if anything was going to prevent me from getting it by the with never heard back from them sent them an email a couple of days ago since i noticed the cards were stuck in the queue doing nothing for 4 days received no response called them today aug with to check on the cards and they told me i would be getting them on monday i needed the cards for an event on sunday receiving the cards on monday would be pointless it turns out that they outsourced the cards to a printer outside of the country asked for a discount to at least recover some of the 500 i just spent for nothing and after much convincing they offered me off my next order really my next order after this you expect me to order from you again if there was an at cost discount for this flub i would remain a loyal customer but telling someone they will receive a discount for their next order after royally screwing them is just an insult|0

biggest waste of money in my entire life reserved a party bus for a friends bachelor party for 4 hours during the afternoon the party bus looked like it had been in a demolition derby scratches and dents everywhere shotty patch work and the rear bumper was crooked took over a half an hour to get the music to play on their sound system the driver had no clue how to operate the audio system so we were left on our own to try and fix it it happened to be raining that day and the rain was leaking through the roof and dripping on us on top of all that the driver attempted to drop us off a half hour early for no particular reason awful experience all around|0
do not bring your camera here i brought my panasonic mirror less camera in because the pins inside the so card slot got bent and wouldnt read cards seems like a pretty simple fix for a camera repair shop but i guess i was wrong after two weeks they informed me that the entire motherboard would have to be replaced in the camera fast forward a month and i call to ask for an update they tell me that the part has come in and my camera would be ready later that week after a full week i called back to see what was going on they then said that the part hadnt come in yet and they werent sure when it would be delivered despite my frustration i still waited another month had passed and they called to say i could pick up my camera i picked up my camera today and the problem with the so card reader was fixed however after getting home and playing around with the camera i realized the camera has brand new problems that it never had before now the eve doesnt work at all and the leveler to see if the camera is balanced is completely off a camera without a viewfinder is pretty useless now i have to bring my camera back in and probably be without my camera for another 2 months please bring your camera somewhere else|0
zero stars is what i would give them if i could i called them on a thursday about tires for my dodge van motorhome he said he would have to call around and he would call me back i already knew amazon has a firestone tire for me but i wanted this place to install them they never called me back now on monday i went there and asked about the tires they were clueless about my inquiry and told me that they were unable to help me because they couldnt do it i said it was only 1 ton dodge van she just said sorry we cant handle it i should have known the last time i dealt with them i needed an alignment on my cherokee they quoted me a price 3 times what tire works charged me|0
i love this place my 12 yr old took his friends here for his birthday it has ample space to give plenty of comfort to each party and the ambient is right on point they have a back room with lots of board games and a big collection of manga books prices are fair a coffee tea bakery space would be a nice addition the owner is super helpful and knows his stuff the only reason im giving it 4 is because i dont have a point of comparison here in la or anywhere else for that matter|1
i like this place visited today i like the emphasis on local foods in addition to lots of obscure and unusual items from far away definitely not a chain retailer it is a very old fashioned store been around a long time and set in its ways the staff seemed generally personable and tried to be helpful to me they have excellent freshly ground peanut butter and a nice selection of local honeys|1
be very careful before signing a contract to hold a spot for a potential incoming student there is a 300 cancellation fee other private housing at other universities tend to charge 50 to 100 to hold a spot so long as you cancel relatively early before may 1 for example not bromley they charge 300 this is outrageous i cancelled my sons contract in february after he decided to attend another university this was far before many students even were admitted or the housing was finalized this place takes advantage of the situation|0

the weight of my 4 year old shower door was causing the dorian shower wall to separate for the drywall i understood the warranty had expired and asked the company that installed the door to correct the problem i dont know why they had to look up my original work order but that is what they said had to be done and that they would call back that evening never heard back from them so i picked a 5 star review company and asked them to fix the problem after looking at my shower door they said i had to reinforce the wall and have a new 560 door installed the owner promised to call back that evening to pick up a deposit and have me sign a contract can you believe he blew me off too as it turns out dependable glass is only a few miles from home and i called to find out if they had a showroom carmen answered my questions and invited me to a nicely setup showroom from the showroom one can view the shop area again a clean and well thought out setup i was so impressed with carmen and the shop i picked a replacement door and sat down in as you can probably guess another nice neat office area to get things started once i explained the problem she said that they repair doors with these issues all the time three days later jason and victor showed up on time to see what they could do off came the door in went a screw long enough to go through the dorian and drywall and into the existing ex wall stud the door frame and shower wall were pulled tight to the drywall and voila no more problem everything was cake i and left very clean i saved 500 although i only interacted with carmen jason and victor i am impressed with the business stephen took care in creating good business plan good people 5 stars|1

this review is just for the lunch buffet at the railroad pass casino we visited today and noticed the signs offering a 2 for 1 special on the lunch buffet what a deal we thought well it was a deal but the food on the buffet was probably the worst i had ever had at a casino buffet weve been to quite a few too to begin with much of the food was only lukewarm the fried chicken was dry and barely warm we wondered if any of the cooks chef ever checked the food on the line pizza meatballs and potatoes were hot the other items we tasted were not tried one piece of pie and thought it might be banana but after a bite or two still couldnt determine what it was may be dinner is better not sure but not willing to give it another try|0

love the burgers love the fries love the spicy ketchup wait times are pretty short and staff is always very friendly i dont come here too often but occasionally they seem to remember me which is always nice at any business the best part about them is that theyre open 24 hours so after a long road trip to northern or southern az i can stop by here on the way home when im absolutely starving but too tired to cook anything and its too late to order anything else|1
my favourite asian patisserie they have so many cakes puffs bread croissants you name it the bakeries with milky or fruity fillings are so satisfying and they have savoury buns too the most thing i have to mention is that they are really cheap u can just get everything you want but be aware that u may gain a lot of weight|1
yes this is a big park with lots of space to let your dogs run around however this dog park needs to be better organized or regulated dog owners come and leave their dogs to run around without any oversight we saw 1520 dogs running around and only 56 people in the park there needs to be a small dog sectioned off area our small puppy got attacked by an aggressive german shepard who kept trampling on him and biting him thank god i was right near my pup and was able to wrestle him away after a few minutes when we yelled whose german shepard this was no one would claim him someone told us it belongs to an old guy but he was nowhere in the park long story short big park but beware of irresponsible dog owners with aggressive dogs because it is an off leash park|0

edit daniel rosenbaum is a smug con artist and only cares about taking advantage of low income families they say they will give you a discount on rent if you lie and give them a 5 star review enjoy your large nice home with your perfect family you piece of trash i do not live on this property but the father of my kids does and i am completely disgusted by how little they care for the grounds here units off mesa do and sou as i was putting my kids in the car i noticed at my feet were multiple heroine needles and one even being full of something black i have been inside the units a hand full of times and the place is falling apart all over there is no lighting in the parking lot giving anyone the perfect place to shoot up drugs or break into cars constant police activity and sketchy people walking around at all hours if this place burnt down to the ground it would probably be the best thing to happen to their company its so disgusting that people have complained and they do absolutely nothing about it needles everywhere trash everywhere and even used condoms in the parking lot do not rent from these scam artists stay far away|0

not sure what to expect but i was pleasantly surprises we bought our tickets at tix for tonight to save money but we actually lost see pic for difference they said doors open at 840 for up show but didnt let is in til 906 which was irksome theater sits 700 so i really wouldnt buy expensive seats as a matter of fact they moved us to the lower half since we were the only ones sitting the furthest not sure if it was to be nice or that it looked funny of a half full theatre the screens give you puppet show view but then you can see the puppeteers at work on stage which was very cool to see how they made the illusions it started out slow and i was thinking im yelping a 3 but then it became a 4 and ended with a 5 they did 2 vintage henson skits from 1965 so cool and nos talc cally simple loved that audience participation was very similar to whos line is it anyway so not only talented but quick witted favorite puppet eet es were tyler and grant two skits had me laughing so hard tears were rolling down my face because it is 90 improv you can easily see a different show each time cant wait to take my husband who loves the muppets it is seriously rated i so i hope parents read that sometimes a little too much of the i word where it littered the skit rather than enhanced the emcee was awesome too he reminded me of next top model tommy gun show is hilarious loved it so much it is a little pricey so 40 is about right dont upgrade or buy at tix 4 tonight booth glad i went its a good memory my off shared i will remember it always|1

experience varies with this company depending on who shows up one time was great the plumber worked fast and efficiently another time the boss had to come out because the worker couldnt find the gas leak the ord time was my last try with them they overcharged me by almost 2 hours when i called to complain the owner said he had to charge for the trip to my house and back im in madison and theyre in madison their shop is definitely not an hour away from my house so they must have stopped for lunch or something if you use them better get a firm price quote lest you want to get surprised when the bill comes|0

the people who work here always know an ungodly amount of information about video games and can make useful suggestions as to what you may like based on prior games youve played and enjoyed loses a star because the lack of used games available is limo or tant this shop is best for brand new consoles and their games but anything other than current gen is going to be tough to find|1

honestly this store is a huge disappointment they have only a handful of carts one being from walmart they always seem to be out of balloons and for some strange reason always out of plastic forks either its a popular item or they never order enough to stock shelves one of the two things i come to the dollar tree exclusively for theres also an employee who works there who is usually listening to explicit music without headphones and talking about explicit activities shes doing or did huge turn off as a customer that has to hear all that store is dirty employees are definitely questionable hires and usually not well stocked and very disorganized school supply aisle|0

went to new a more sports grill with my wife and 3 kids my son loves the a more pizza in cowell man ranch and thought that this would give us a place for the kids and mom and dad to have a beer as well packed my pocket with quarters as the kids love video games etc on a friday night there were about 20 pal in the bar and a few families in the restaurant we sat down ordered a burger couple pizzas and wings went over to get the kids setup on the video bowling game sat down to drink my beer when the owner walked over with the kids and said the games are really for adults that they could finish the game as long as i stayed with them video games are adjacent to but not in the bar from what i heard they owners were involved with temple bar in cowell man ranch and did not like the families that came in with kids not sure he they understand the demographics of the area pretty easy to understand with the internet now obviously this is the opinion of a parent so lets talk about the food the burger was ordered medium temp came out dead done my wife and i intended to split it neither us finished our half the wings were huge bigger than normal but were really tough and under cooked the pizza was mediocre at best 12 is smallest and was basically flavorless and had a huge crust bottom line if you want a beer and have the time to drive past zip is temple or lazy lizard try this place if this were the closest place to eat get some gas and keep driving it will likely be better|0

very good food but not quite good enough to justify the price 1015 for entrees rice and naan not included my group tried a few different dishes vegetarian chicken and goat i will say that all the meats were amazingly tender and good however the one dish we ordered mild goat that ura was the only spicy dish everything we ordered spicy came out mild it was still tasty enough that we did not find cause to complain not bad at all but frampton has so many indian options that i am going to keep looking elsewhere|1

amazing atmosphere and great food it has a nice modern updated look kind of like a modern diner also has a terrace and televisions with trending live sports as a kosher restaurant it is comparatively cheap but some items are somewhat pricey like their asian dishes overall the portions are generous and the quality is good service can take some time but it is worth the wait in the end if i could recommend some of their dishes it would be the merge i baguette shish tao uk gaff a or a classic shawarma pita as for their sauces i like their creamy and tangy burger sauce and their insanely spicy sauce if your e up to it|1
this is the worst company i have ever dealt with period from the very start this pool company was unreliable and completely unprofessional and has continued to act that way ever since the only reason i had to stay with them was because of the property management company chris will keep you waiting for hours not show up at all or be as rude as can be he has no respect for anybody i time except his own so dont expect him to ever go out of his way for you stay far far away from this pool company there are so many quality pool companies in this area dont settle for subpar and be hassled and disrespected|0
i went in between working night shifts to have a hair blowout for a wedding to be honest i should have scheduled an up do or haircut my hair is long had no layers and there is a lot of it the blowout wasnt anything great but they just charged 25 which i thought was reasonable the hairdresser ashley suggest i return for a cut another time i made an appointment the next week and was so happy like a previous poster i am shy and had no idea what to do with my hair i normally just go to a cheap place for a trim every few months ashley took charge and gave me some awesome layers she listened to how i need a no fuss style for work and needed to be able to put it all up a week later my boyfriend still keeps telling me how much he loves it i will definitely go back to her in the future then i returned just yesterday for a massage with my best friend they have a special for june a couples massage for 100 one thing i didnt like is that they didnt have a changing room lockers or showers like some nicer places they probably dont have the space they put us in a small dimly lit room with two massage tables and left us to undress the area to stand in was also small so it was a little uncomfortable stripping into your panties and hanging all your clothes on the few hooks on the wall where can i put my shoes so they wont trip over them in the dark we had to take turns the massage itself was so relaxing i could have fallen asleep the lotion was nice and not heavily scented i would go again|1

doctor was mediocre however the office doesnt care about getting your medical records to you or another doctor in a timely manner they told me it could take 30 days for another doctor to receive your records to me that is not quality of care if you go to another doctor in less than 30 days and they cant review your medical records from this hematology office another doctor was able to get me in to their schedule and this office made no attempt to even help me by getting my records to take to this other doctor every other doctors office i have worked with always got my records in a sufficient time this makes me think their office people sit on their a instead of doing their job|0
man this is seriously the best succulent nursery ive been to ive been on a succulent kick and have been literally scouring charlotte and raleigh looking for a quality nursery that had a good selection of succulents malones does not have just a good selection its an overwhelming and extensive collection with probably the best prices ive seen to date decent sized 2 inch succulents for 175 you really cant get any better than that even on amazon they sell if for about 350 a piece and any of the other nurseries ive been to have been averaging that price the succulents at malones are very healthy and happy and again very very reasonably priced if you are looking to expand your succulent collection or looking to start one utilizing trial and error go to malones i will definitely be making the drive to charlotte albeit it two whole hours to go back to malones|1

i had an absolutely awful meal and i took 5 others with me i had scallops 18 and it was a very small portion the scallops were small the size of a nickel tough and fishy tasting the sauce didnt have any flavor the bread was below average may be they just had a bad night i was never there before but they have been around a very long time all i know is if someone gave me a gift card from there i would give or throw it away very overpriced for the offerings|0
our experience here was disastrous they mixed up two customers in the wedding party leading us on a goose chase between sides of town to find the right tuxedo once we found the right one the sizes were entirely wrong and we had to try on various sizes we suggested not the rental people to find the proper ones not appropriate for a 200 rental|0
i absolutely love this place they have an amazing selection of bulk holiday and nostalgic candy the staff was so pleasant and offered samples as soon as i walked in i really appreciated the individually wrapped candy scoops candy stores can be a germ zone with all the kids and i like the effort to keep everything clean the dipping dots fridge was a nice surprise too|1

visits with the gynecologist is an always delicate sometimes retch inducing and always uncomfortable experience that said when visit after visit you have nothing but positive experiences the place definitely needs a shout out i go to new horizons for pregnancy maternity care and have had great experiences so far with all doctors and ups ive met how often do you go to practice that has several providers and you have great experiences with all of them i was afraid that i wouldnt feel very taken care of with so much rotation but each doctor focuses on you when your e there and ive never felt neglected their approach seems to be more hands off which i really appreciate since i want to treat a low risk pregnancy as naturally as possible and take small aches and pains in my stride rather than fuss about it they might seem a bit dismissive to someone less inclined but it put things in perspective for me they also seemed very supportive of natural birth and the advice has always been on the side of reducing the incidences of i sections none of the seemingly sympathetic nods followed by but you should also know that i offer elective inductions if you are sick of it the front office staff are always nice another nice surprise no grumpiness or snapping and id choose this place for that reason alone there is an efficient pager system to move you from place to place and everyone from the front office to the doctors and assistants to the lab and ultrasound people are on top of what is happening i didnt particularly care for the giant macs in each exam room the labs and ultrasounds are sharp on time no waiting i have waited for the doctors about 3040 mins after being checked out by the assistants which has has been irritating but these incidents are fewer than ones where i havent had to wait much update i had a great birth experience with the one doctor that i hadnt met since he was at a distant location overall very recommended for people needing a no fuss attitude|1
this was our first time to blaze pizza and we will be back the staff was so nice and really patient and helpful since it was our first time the size of the pizza would be similar to a medium if you ordered delivery somewhere my husband and i actually said we could have probably shared one it was so delicious and was ready really fast we had chosen a create your own pizza for 825 and loaded it with toppings that were all included in the price i got a side salad and it was amazing i definitely recommend trying out blaze pizza|1
after looking for a local hair stylist i chose la trice based on her stars and pictures she makes you book and pay a deposit on her website my appointment was at am she texted me at am asking me to come in at up that the computer accidently overbooked and i would have her undivided attention i arrived right on time and she had 3 other girls waiting she never even stopped what she was doing to apologize she only asked that i re book online i did i wanted my hair done i wasted my time and money 240 dollars i came washed and blow dried i paid for the natural part with high ponytail not only was i not able to wear my hair up due to her not leaving enough hair out their was visible braids lumps and loose strings i asked her to fix it she replied book online i took out my weave 3 days after install she is not professional and does not care about keeping same clientele|0

most expensive nail place i have ever been to they did my nails while i was getting my pedicure and with two people working on me at once not relaxing they did not coordinate and were both pulling me different directions the gel light almost fell on me multiple times im surprised i didnt burn my hand they then up sold my pedicure halfway through not providing all the parts and making the manicure more expensive because it was not part of the combo they then overcharged me by 10|0
i absolutely love this place to be quite honest its because this was the first time i had good flavour soju if you tried korean soju and hated it because it tasted really gross you have to try this place their flavoured soju out of all the flavours i had tried i suggest yogurt i the large soju is 20 dollars and you get munchies with it for your first order includes salad egg soup mix with tofu sashimi jap chae korean glass noodles butter corn i cant remember what else my friends have ordered chicken wings fries and they are just like most bar places that offer it as for the atmosphere this place is occupied by asian folks ranging from 1830 but if your looking for some asian gangster loving then this is one of the hangouts if you plan to go go around wish because when it hits about wish all booths are taken then your left having to settle for something else because its all packed great place to just chill with people and drink highly suggest it if you want some good tasting korean soju but i warn you its only 20 alcohol therefore youll probably just get tipsy after 3 bottles are so i primarily only go here for their delicious soju yogurt aside from that i dont suggest this as a place where you want to eat your dinner because from time to time they dont have stuff well at least 2 out of 4 times they didnt have any food i had ask for not sure if things have changed tho|1
overall a good place to go and eat some quality food happy hour specials were pretty good with 2 beers the service was friendly prompt and accurate three things that are apparently hard these days so props to the staff for that the chips and salsa bar was a good deal with fresh made salsa to try the tamales are also very good and better than what i was expecting the burritos were cooked well rolled nicely and didnt fall apart the rice and beans was above average and had good flavor on par with some of the better mexican chains around town and far superior to filiberto i would send friends here if they ask for a solid se valley choice|1

this restaurant used to have service ive witnessed an employee ask if she could help bus tables a manager said no were fine weve not had a drink for 15 minutes and are still waiting for food i understand its busy but there are 9 people standing at the counter appears to be 5 people in the back and no one checking on anyones drinks it was better when they left the carafe of coffee but they dont do that anymore so they can interact more with customers thats crap hope the food is at least warm food was cold but i cant hive 12 stars|0
this was our and visit to this location the first after they just opened we came in around 130 on a sunday afternoon not too busy as we were sat in less than 10 min my wife and i decided to get the stuffed deep dish pizza we always enjoy their thin crust so we thought this should be good as we were ordering the waitress told us the deep dish can take up to 45 mins to bake since we werent sure we wanted to wait that long we told her to make it a thin crust she then told us it would be 30 mins for a thin crust so we decided for an extra 15 mins we would stay with the deep dish over an hour later the pizza was finally delivered to our table and we were both starving after a couple of bites we both looked at each other and remarked how hard and thick the crust was i was nearly impossible to cut it with a knife not only hard but absolutely no flavor to it we ended up just eating the filling out of our slice which was good we both did not want any more when our waitress came back she said that the manager wanted to buy us dessert for our wait but we literally lost our appetite from the pizza we may go back again but never will order that pizza again yuck|0
i am very disappointed with child time i had scheduled tours to see 1111 i horne mesa az and 5154 e adobe it mesa az horne location last week and adobe today the representatives on the phone both times scheduled me without checking the availability of the school for the location off horne i was contacted by a representative at the location whom basically told me not to bother come in because they were full she had little interest in even asking me when i wanted to enroll my children and i felt she was rushing me off the phone i was scheduled to tour the adobe red location today on april ith at 530 am once again i received a call from this location just letting me know they wont have availability until this summer which is fine because i was looking for a june start date upon my arrival the story changed once i said june would actually work it was then after the summer i was a offered a tour but the staff seemed disinterested as they were really busy and they were full anyways so i didnt see the point if they werent really interested in giving me a tour i dont really think my kids will be taken care of well how could they if they are overwhelmed with a student population so im glad at least two of the child times are busy and dont need anymore business thats fine though i will grant them their wish and bring my kids to another daycare center that wants our business my kids there is i am sending this feedback because yes it was that bad ive looked at other daycare and everyone has been very friendly even if they were full and would work with me to get my kids in when they could|0
this school is excellent in every way my child has learned an incredible amount in the 19 months of attending we intend to complete the kindergarten semesters here too the staff is wonderful and the children are thoughtful polite and so blessed to spend their days here the school grounds are very well kept and my child enjoys the animals and the garden so much i love that the school not only focuses on challenging curriculum but also teaches many useful practical life skills my child has learned to be independent in many ways awesome experience i only wish they could multiply their resources to accommodate higher grade levels we will be sad to leave albeit prepared for whatever primary school we choose|1
i was referred to do victor ann is by my oncologist without getting into my personal life to much do ann is is one of the most unprofessional doctors ive ever seen to say the least i have had breast cancer ex in the last yrs and was sent to him for a surgical evaluation he never gave me a professional evaluation nor the common courtesy to someone who has gone through as much as i have however after leaving his office abruptly he did have the audacity to note and send off his medical opinion after spending 2 minutes with me i will never recommend him to anyone ever|0
awful do not come here i came here to bring the puppy who was seeming way too lethargic for a puppy right away we were told to do all of these tests which cost since were not made of money we opted against it but asked what we could do the for the puppy we were given a handful of medications that could treat anything and everything since we didnt do any testing which we were constantly reminded of infield left us waiting 3 hours because there was a sick dog in the next room i dont understand it because we were just waiting for the meds we kept hearing the laughing and gossiping from the vet techs but no one offered to give us the meds so we could leave on top of that they kept trying to push their insurance on us sorry im poor stop trying to push your sales on me im only here to help my puppy i felt like we left with more questions and nothing was answered the next day we went to the big easy animal hospital and found out it was because the puppy has hyperglycemic no test needed just a fact about the breed i dont know what those idiots at infield were thinking puppy is now fine and acting like a regular puppy|0

i was brought to this location for a wedding on friday 21 may 2010 everything was delightful decorations wait staff location the wedding ceremony itself was absolutely gorgeous reception included ceremony outdoors reception indoors one complaint is of the woman whom i later found out was the receptionist of the place i heard the room was rented out until midnight before midnight ever came the receptionist was already shooing us out the door her main reason was that she was tired and wanted to go home another is the bartender assigned to make drinks for the wedding i dont know why but she had an attitude going on that night and at one point even refused to make drinks because she got in trouble go figure the bar towards the back of the building also had a lovely staff the bartender was helpful in trying to accommodate me with something to drink all in all the location was awesome but because of the incidents with the receptionist and the bartender i give it 2 stars|0

a warning to any woman who wants to try to do business with them they think it is the 1950s and refuse to make an appointment for an estimate without your spouse present they say it is because they bring samples and need the spouse to help make the decision but i insisted multiple times that my husband would not need to be present and i would be the decision maker and they still wouldnt drop it i went as far as telling the sales person that if he didnt move on from his questioning about when my husband would be home i would hang up he continued on telling me that he had to be present so i hung up its 2018 couples work together and delegate tasks they work as teams if a couple feels that only one member of the unit needs to be present to make a decision about freaking windows that should be respected this company will never get my business and i will warn all my friends to stay away extremely disrespectful|0

this place is pretty awful i have a fairly high tolerance for most food even terrible food but this was gawd awful i always feel bad about not finishing my food because obviously were blessed to have food to eat but i had to sacrifice my principles and stop eating i find it funny that people think that just because a restaurant smells of bo has a few authentic vietnamese waiters and chefs that the food is good authentic may be but good no please do yourself a favor and do not eat here vietnamese food is amazing this place not so much|0
we were referred to blue wave pools by a friend who had amazing service from the first day we met john and marcia we were immediately at peace with our investment decision this company gave us excellent customer service helped us to chose the perfect pool for our budget and kept us updated on the progress of what to expect i would highly recommend this pool company|1
so many problems with this place i dont know where to begin if you have a female child she will never ever ever get anywhere attending here and if she does it will be much slower than the boys dont sign a contract either thats how they get you if you cancel in time well that doesnt matter either as they still run your card over and over again i had to hire attorney for several reasons and we are dealing with the bob and the news as other parents are cooperating as well anywhere and i mean anywhere is better than this place oh and even if you dont sign a release for them to use your childs pictures you will notice after a while that they are plastered everywhere all over their sites for marketing not ok|0

came here for lunch it was just terrible nothing was fresh or seemed to be made with care the lobster burger was bland like it was put in the microwave before being tossed on two cold buns fries similarly tasted like it was reheated straight from the freezer the place has an identity problem theres an affordable lunch menu on display out front which is why i went during my break but once inside i get offered a wine menu for lunch and wait 40 minutes for a burger our group were the only people there and we ordered simple meals too the decor is like my grandparents living room i get that i should expect much from a lobster burger or plain old fish and chips but they have to get basics right the food tasted stale and like something i could buy from a grocery store freezer i wont be coming back|0
this is probably the worse experience ive ever had we agreed with their salesman at the door to pay by cash at the end of each service but unfortunately what their salesman promised at the door wasnt recorded onto their system thats ok but you failed to deliver what you promised only showed up twice a year supposed to be 4 the rest 2 you said you sprayed outside and left didnt knock on the door or anything because you assumed everything is perfect so no interior spray required well how am i suppose to pay your service when you dont even let us know your e here the worse part is that i just spoke on the phone with their customer service long story short she wants her technician to get paid first then do the job that you promised to make up for us but we want to see them do the job first then happy to pay them at the end with full amount i requested to speak to their supervisor manager she said sorry we dont have any manager i am the manager then him later finally told me my manager isnt around at this time and hang up on me at the end of the call good job terminal you have totally disappointed me and my family hope you take some time reflect and train your staff with proper system and attitude towards your customers|0

last year i bought a large silver colored bracelet from john which was marked 925 which indicates sterling silver i had some links taken out to make it fit i felt it was basically a mans bracelet and took it back this year to have the links put back in so my son could wear it john made a huge mess out of those 5 links and something copper was showing through i took it to another jeweler hoping they could fix it and found out it was not silver but copper plated it is basically worth nothing and i paid over 100 for it originally now i dont know what to do with it and am also wondering about the new bracelet i also bought from him a few weeks ago that is also marked 925 silver watch what you buy from this vendor i think they do ok because most of their clients are visitors and they never see them again they are located in old town scottsdale which is a tourist area|0
absolutely disgusted with this place after having my dogs there and paying over 4000 over the course of two months my dog losing 20 pounds and inhaling that awful smell of mixing ammonia and bleach on multiple occasions it just goes to show how unprofessional this place is they are hands down the most disrespectful ful business owners ive ever encountered in my whole life and when you have a valid concern over the safety of the animals that are in their i supervision they tell you if you dont like the way they do things that you can come grab your dogs in go elsewhere the part that upsets me the most is the fact that i would have to go there every single day to ensure my dogs were getting food because it didnt seem like they were and im almost positive they werent until i got the news involved un professionalism and passive aggressive business owners means that this business wont be around much longer thats for sure|0
i first visited caffe artigiano in vancouver 3 years ago that was my first foray foray into specialty for lack of a better word coffee and ive been hooked ever since i was super excited to see them open here in toronto and i was eager to see if it was as good as i remembered 1 the coffee the espresso is strong and well balanced the milk is steamed to the perfect temperature and the ratios of es press milk micro foam in the espresso based drinks are spot on their spanish latte is a must try 2 the ambiance i love that it is bright spacious and there is plenty of seating in addition to standard 2 4 person tables there are large tables for communal gatherings and comfortable armchairs for relaxing there is free wifi and because it is so spacious you will never feel self conscious for settling in for a while 3 the people friendly unpretentious decent human beings unlike some other cafes where the staff act like theyre gods and your e just a plebe there are definitely places in and around downtown toronto that serve more unique and interesting espresso roasts but caffe artigiano offers coffee at a price comparable to second cup starbucks but at a higher level of consistency and quality if your e downtown and looking for a good cup of coffee caffe artigiano should definitely be on your radar|1

after testing the waters at other pilates studio i can truly say this is the best in the pox valley be prepared for some butt kicking when you go the jump boards are both my most hated while being most loved things christina especially gives you an amazing workout so much that my friend and i nicknamed her machina seriously best workout in an hour for all over tone strengthening all of the instructors are great and with smaller class sizes about 8 they can give each person individual attention plus they are all about the safe way to do things so i always felt assured i wasnt going to leave with an injury although you will definitely leave sore it wont be from improper form|1

i placed an on line order for 24 jimmy minis at am for pick up at up arrived around 615 and the order hadnt been started they managed to make the order in about 1015 minutes while i waited they didnt know how to package the sandwiches in the box i had to explain it because ive ordered these from other locations in the past when they were almost finished with the order an employee came out from the back and the girl working on the order asked if he knew about it he said yes and shrugged it was clear he knew my order was needed for up and chose not to make it worst part was that when it was finished they just handed me the box without any hint of an apology that it wasnt ready despite being ordered 11 hours in advance not exactly freaky fast|0

i love the lunch buffet at march masala and im so glad that it has reopened my husband and i go to many indian restaurants in madison and this particular restaurant chef is our favorite i find that their ingredients are fresher and better than some other places nearby my particular favorites are their goat curry veggie noodles tandoori chicken and their sweet naan peshawar i what i think sets this place apart are the slight alterations the chef makes to the usual dishes for example the palak paneer has more than just spinach in it i think the chef puts in some leek too which i find quite surprising and pleasant sometimes there is a slight biq sauce in the tandoori chicken which is awesome it isnt the same as other traditionally indian restaurants perhaps due to the nepalese influence i really appreciate what this chef owner is doing with the food he was originally the chef of many known establishments but saved his money up to get a place of his own where he can cook the food he wants and i respect that and hope this restaurant does well in this hidden location|1
we love this place so glad we have it in harrisburg the beer cheese dip with the fries is amazing love the wing flight great flavors|1

the front office staff medical assistants are the least helpful least knowledgeable and least friendly staff i have ever encountered they are not competent enough to complete simple tasks fax to the correct place review lab results send out orders ect i dont expect much being those jobs require little to no education if you want a smooth experience this is not the place especially if you have needs of long term treatment the do is knowledgeable and professional but unfortunately the assistants ruin the office|0
i have been coming here for the last five years the doctor i was initially seeing no longer works here and i was not informed until arriving decided to just change doctors since this is the only office ive ever been to front desk is always pleasant every time i come in and see a nurse instead of do schoen haus i would tell them my concerns and they make me feel like im stupid i have been trying to find the right birth control for me the last couple years once nex plan on stopped being the right fit long story short the symptoms that i would experience after the insertion of the i'd was brushed away i decided to remove my i'd and i was questioned why which is understanding i let them know that i felt like i was moody way too often and the pain and irritation that came with it was too much in response i was told that i shouldnt feel moody because the copper i'd is non hormonal i must have offended her because usually im told when i would feel pressure or when things were going to be removed from my body not this time she pulled out the i'd i felt the same pressure and pain as when it was initially inserted then she left some of the medical assistants are nice and others ask you what brings you in you start to tell them then it becomes too much and they cut you off if your e going to come here i suggest only seeing the doctor theyll show you compassion and make you feel like your e being heard|0

there are a lot of les in the valley so i like to frequent all of them as i can at least once i noticed the coral life come up a few times in the local reef forums on fu so i figured id stop in went in a couple weeks ago no other customers in the store and keith was working on some equipment but greeted me and said hed be with me in a minute so i took a gander at his coral stock he finished up and we started shooting the breeze about coral his store and such cool guy very knowledgeable about the market and his products i ended up getting a neon hammer frag and a bottle of para guard treating a mimic lemon peel tang in it for popeye side note has worked well and fish showed reduced symptoms in 24 hours stopped in again this week to is talk about his upcoming coral shipment and pick up some different food options for a picky nano being in the hobby for quite some time now its always interesting to find an intimate for lack of a better term store front and i believe keith is doing a great job with this approach in our conversations he did mention his online presence sales trump his walk in sales but there wasnt any accompanying arrogance as stated in other reviews it was simply matter of fact based on location i can understand that the storefront would be more of a destination visit as opposed to foot traffic happenstance which naturally affects where the shop stands in its sales perspective at any rate ill be stopping in the store next week to check out the new shipment and shoot the poop with keith again if your e in the area id suggest you pop in and take a peep|1

my husband and i ate here to start off our week in montreal started with the marrow and brussel sprouts marrow was very overpriced small and the biq sauce took away from the taste not worth it at all brussels were very tasty and the bacon and parmesan added a nice balance we then split the hunters rabbit this was an interesting and hearty dish the cava tell i reminded me of larvae but the taste made up for it it was cooked perfectly and the hunters sauce made you go back to the dish for more the ambiance was relaxed and the smell of was a nice touch i expected the menu to be a little more exotic given how the restaurant markets itself the choice of game meat was small and basic|1

my husband and i were very excited to try this new to us restaurant with music we arrived at 645pm on a friday evening and the wait for dinner was set at 35 minutes we were offered a seat at the sofas which was fine observation we commented as we sat at the sofas waiting for a waiter waitress to attend to us that it was odd to have 3 hostesses standing around while we waited for service from the wait staff after a bit of time too long our waitress asked us for a drink order we were still hopeful of an outstanding outcome minutes later the hostesses unexpectedly directed us to a table it should be noted that it was not extremely busy shortly thereafter we ordered our meal i ordered the shrimp and my husband ordered the sea bass dinner arrived very quickly and after one bite i asked the waitress to return my meal the shrimp was quite possibly the cherie it and the most poorly executed shrimp i have had in a while our waitress suggested the daily special tuna i immediately agreed but asked that it be prepared medium to medium well i do not enjoy rare tuna we ordered a second round of drinks and while my husband completed his meal i waited for my replacement meal it never came and a different waiter came to clear my husbands dishes away and asked if we wanted dessert where was our waitress we explained our circumstance and asked him to fetch our waitress shortly thereafter the night manager arrived i explained my frustration at not receiving my replacement meal which to any professional would have been understood and supported however she did not she immediately displayed an attitude harshly repeating that i ordered my tuna well cooked and it takes a while i explained to her that it should never take any more than 1015 minutes to replace she said they had other customers that took priority over my replacement order she also stated that is was her job to tell us how their business is conducted my husband was shocked he asked her to stop telling us how we should feel she responded by telling him that she will not listen to someone being disrespectful to her what i asked by husband to let me handle it i again clearly explained without emotion how disappointed i was and that i no longer was willing to wait for the replacement meal and asked her for a check after a few minutes she returned explaining to me that we would not be charged for my returned shrimp dinner or the tuna but she had it boxed up to send with me again inappropriate of course i would not pay for either meal that i did not receive and or accept i would never eat the boxed meal she left me given the animosity shown we asked for the main managers contact information finally the owner came over and we explained our extreme dissatisfaction at our treatment after a lively but very friendly and professional exchange she asked us what we wanted we responded nothing but good service and a good attitude it should be no surprise we did not want a free meal we did not want special considerations we simply wanted a good meal and good service and respectful treatment from her painfully inept manager the owner was extremely professional but our experience was already ruined and we just wanted to leave she left us with her card and asked us to give them another chance it will be hard to forget the extremely poor service from her chosen management team i cant imagine dealing with her very rude manager again time will tell if we choose to attempt this experience again good service is a prerequisite in this highly competitive restaurant world gilbert downtown is a hopping and successful dinner environment and a drive south should be worth it this was not|0

great new brewery i had to go to pittsburgh for work and took the weekend to walk around taking the sights and trying restaurants and bar while aimlessly exploring the strip area i stumbled upon the milkman brewery sign i could barely believe there was a brewery there i looked upon a faceless building with massive wooden door and a small industrial looking door that i tried to open upon entering i still wasnt sure what was going on because i saw a desolate space with signs of construction looking up at the top of the stairs there was a sign that said this way with some voices so i went up this brewery definitely reminds me of my own brewing effort at home meeting the two bartenders owners brewers i saw that this was a labor of love and a homegrown effort i asked them if i can do a flight and they said they did not do flights however i could try every beer for free i just wanted a tasting so i had my flight and consoled my conscience with a big tip one of the most unique beers ive ever had was their peppercorn beer they add green and white and black peppercorn into the brew giving it a peppery and woody taste i could not imagine a better beer to drink while eating a steak the guys here are real nice they offered to give me a tour and it was quite easy to do because the brewing as well as serving was all done in one small room it felt like a home brewer decided to expand out of their garage a little bit because they had three mash turns about 50 gallons each tiny for a brewery massive for the home the atmosphere could not possibly be any chiller unique place hopefully as they grow they will add chairs and table so you can go for extended sessions of drinking here what might be holding them back is how much they can serve because they have such a small operation the small size adds to the charm of the place too super unique beers i would recommend this place if youve ever brewed your own|1
bagel was passable but nothing to rave about service was quick the place was filthy drink station was a mess the corners were full of grime where it was critical to be clean it was but still it bugged me|0
this place is definitely a rip off whatever products they use to demonstrate the products in store are not in the bottles they sell you i brought a heap based on a wrinkle that he removed and was still gone 5 days later and after thinking about it over the week i went back and brought it along with other things foolishly 800 as he kept adding more things i went up to my room at planet hollywood and tried it out guess what no wrinkle removed not even slightly absolutely nothing lucky for me when i marched down the next day i got a full refund just put on your nothing is going to budge me face and preferably go in store when they have other customers they dont want them hearing you make a fuss the worse thing is that wrinkle is still gone 2 weeks later so i would love to know what the products are they actually use for demonstration stay clear folks this is pure fake stuff|0

the first couple of times i went to this place they did a reasonable although not spectacular job and were very friendly and helpful so i thought the bad reviews were just sour grapes or cranky people nope they are right on not long ago i went in again and paid for their top of the line regular wash as usual which was to include an interior cleaning i had just barely sat down in the waiting area before they told me the car was done they hadnt even touched the interior hadnt vacuumed hadnt even wiped down the dash or cleaned the windows and they left the trash right where it was then they flat out refused to do any of it including toss the trash saying that throwing out the trash wasnt their job hello seriously i have never come across a car wash that has copped an attitude like this and they refused to do any of the rest of the interior because of the things i had on the floor and some of the seats would not even touch it when i complained they nastily told me to get out of there and not to come back they did at least refund my money but i would have far rather just have had my car cleaned why do people work at a car wash if theyre not willing to you know actually clean cars|0

do not work with tino i repeat do not work with tino tino provided false information he stated that it would cost my regular monthly bill to put a phone line on suspension i already thought he was being sketchy because what purpose would it serve to put a line on suspension if i would have to pay my regular monthly bill which was 160 a month for 3 lines immediately called att customer care then was told it would only cost 10 per line month for the suspension what horrible customer service from a sales rep i already had a feeling he was playing dumb when he provided that false information i repeat do not work with tino i hope the manager sees this and confronts him what a joke|0
i was told that this saint vincent de paul is a refuge at night for men and women having an emergency and that it is surrounded by an iron fence to ensure safety the first night i went by i wondered if i had the wrong address and was at a brothel instead because i could hear a young female moaning loudly outside as if she was engaged in a sexual act and i saw a few women huddled together who made vulgar remarks then i realized the women were listening to pornography the second time i went by i saw women being sneaked through the fence after dark clearly no one wanting anyone to know they were there even though i was told that no one is allowed on the property after a certain time again to ensure safety the women acted like they were high and one asked who there had the inaudible because her buzz was wearing off feeling uneasy i checked the area where this saint vincent de paul is located during the day and there was a swarm of people gathered outside of the fence who interacted with each other like they are running a business and were impatient to get into saint vincent de paul so they could get to work so i asked an older sickly woman who sounded autistic and whose pale skin was rather sunburned from having to be outside what the refuge is like she blurted out that all the employees on the other side of the fence work for the people outside and they will torment her and tell cass security to throw her out until she learns to tell everyone that the people at saint vincent de pals refuge are nice needless to say i suspect this is not a refuge|0
i once managed a very busy very new pizza place i understand there are always kinks to work out and this can be tough especially when someone accidentally drives a car through your storefront earlier that day but there is no excuse for the only guests in your restaurant to have to wait 25 minutes for 2 one topping pizzas a nonfunctioning soda fountain and pizza that tastes like but is twice as expensive as dominos located in the same shopping center sorry guys|0

look some place else i give this property 2 stars strictly based on the awesome location the lack in professionalism security responsiveness follow through and accountability gets old at around your first 2 months the security guards are a joke unfortunately pic property group has bought up many different residential buildings downtown from what i hear the management is the same the good news there are a few new renovations being done through other ownership look at those or even the strip district stuck in my lease until february among the other complaints the renovations done were done half assed my recessed lighting flickers constantly the microwave doesnt work and they told me to only use liquid dishwasher detergent as the fix to the dishwasher problems i could go on i moved out here from do paying almost the same in rent and getting a horrible deal|0
needing something quick i booked arms to help move a large sectional and my experience with them was great steve was quick to respond with a quote that was far more reasonable than other companies wanting to charge a two hour minimum plus unknown extras he booked my reservation with an exact time not some long open window like other guys he called me to confirm and again when he was in route to the job which was comforting and he came prepared was professional friendly and quick thanks guys will recommend to others|1

i gets down with web hands down this has to be my favourite brunch spot in the city allow me the chance to explain why 1 soul in a bowl whenever i describe oe is breakfast poutine to friends family and random strangers on the street most feel this is the most innovative breakfast offering since lucky charms more recently they have taken the soul in the bowl to the next level by adding multiple variations much like fishing in your bowl of cereal for rainbow shaped marshmallows you will be searching for lucky charms of a different sort such as pork belly smoked salmon and scallops served a top duck fat fried breakfast potatoes quebec curds and a rich hollandaise sauce get me a napkin im salivating just thinking about it 2 i love lox the steelhead smoked salmon at web is some of the best lox i have had in my life they cant do any wrong with it place it on a piece of cardboard and sprinkle some dirt on it id probably ask for seconds 3 eggy goodness if your e calling your business over easy you better know how to make an egg right to order i havent been disappointed yet with their egg oneness if you want your egg a little runny they will nail it for you no sweat next time im going to keep them on their toes and ask for my eggs in a or me rule 4 massive menu keeps everyone happy serious its huge they have something for everyone whether you have a bit of a sweet tooth are a vegetarian or a carnivore its kid friendly as well so bring your young ones its not uncommon to have to wait a while to get a table during the weekends but its always been worth the wait just ask the host for a cup of coffee and sit out front and watch the world pass by until your table is ready the service is outstanding every time and is worth a little extra gratuity when you pay for the bill the interior is very small but i find it to be quite cozy go to web|1

this is the closest pub to my home so i know it well pros the kitchen is open late and they are decently priced they could use some better fries but other than that everything i have ordered has been surprisingly good this is a huge factor for me as i work quite late the bartenders are friendly and the customer base is mostly local plenty of specials on food the bartender terry teri is fabulous cons too often there are many off duty staff members clustered around the bar drinking and distracting the on duty staff from customers music can also get loud and inappropriate during these times although there are many screens to watch a game the sound is terrible and the sight lines are awkward it seems you always have a post or something obstructing your view for the convenience i do go to this place quite a bit overall its the best combo of location and quality for my needs if not for the location i would not likely go as often if at all|0
closed i was suspicious when there was no answer as i tried to place a delivery order i went by there and it was obviously closed too bad food was great|1
my first visit to nicholas hare on front it came after i visited the stores ottawa location a month or so prior somehow id missed out on venturing to the to shop until then but after seeing its beauty in ottawa i had to make a trip posthaste simply put nicholas hare is a gorgeous bookstore wood floors and shelves comfy couches and a fireplace but for me even more beautiful than all that is the actual way in which they display the books on the shelves the vast majority of books are displayed front facing your e not stuck browsing through often rather boring spines at this shop your e looking right at the hopefully usually beautifully designed covers of course logistically this means that they cant stock as many books on the shelves as indigo would in this same amount of space but trust me its well worth the tradeoff not only is this tactic more aesthetically pleasing but its also just so much more useful to the customers truly a genius decision on the part of nicholas hare and the main reason i could never give this shop any less than a 5 out of 5|1
spoke to nancy on the phone and she insisted i come in to meet her even though i preferred to just set everything up over the phone typical high pressure salesman tactic this should have been warning 1 but ok fine i set up an appointment i get to her office at the appointment time and shes not even there so let me get this right you insist on me coming in to meet you and then dont even show up this is the most disrespectful thing you can ever do to a customer i have been a long time state farm customer but the agents in las vegas so far are really letting me down|0
horrible panda express ive ever been too they only gave me 3 pieces of honey walnut and no sauce on my teriyaki chicken worst panda in vegas|0
super tasty quite close the renaissance hotel and rue saint catherine and while it is only open for lunch during the week it was so worth it the decor is nice and authentically swiss attentive service and the vegetarian rossi was extremely tasty the cheese vegetables and potatoes made an amazing combination the house salad was also quite tasty with pickled vegetables and a fresh dressing would definitely recommend going here|1

read the fine print on any agreements carefully i was in the process of starting up a new business and signed up for a 12 month virtual office agreement but a couple of months into the agreement i started a full time job instead and had to delay doing anything with the new business knowing that i had signed up for 12 months i paid my 89 a month without a single complaint while never stepping inside the facility once or utilizing a single service 20 months pass and i finally get around to asking what actions i need to take to cancel the agreement and was told that i was supposedly sent a notice 90 days prior to the 12 month term that i would be renewed automatically for another 12 months since i only received about 5 emails a month on this particular email account with at least two of them being from regs invoice card transaction confirmation i was able to review every email i had ever received within a couple of minutes while still on the telephone with a regs representative and sure enough no notice but was told it didnt matter the agreement states automatic 12 month renewal without written cancellation while i would agree its my fault for not reading the fine print and paying closer attention to the charges ive never had a lease or term agreement that auto renews for another full term without a new agreement everything ive ever experienced has been month to month after the expiration of a specific term regs reminds me of the health clubs that used to sucker people into 3 year terms and would do everything they could to force people to pay for those 3 years after paying 1068 for 12 months that i committed to while never utilizing a single service and having no complaints you would think a business that collected another 712 for 8 additional months would be accommodating to a cancellation request but no they state theres nothing they can do and i must pay the additional 356 for the final 4 months buyer beware horrible customer service and somewhat crooked in my opinion|0
my wife received poor service and told me never to return out of convenience to where i live i paid their high prices never enjoying their service but appreciating the quality of their dry cleaning i should have listened to my wife do summers offers high quality dry cleaning however construction on van a ken made the trip dismal and it is naturally out of the way this afternoon it appeared as if the female owner did not want to give me my dry cleaning because all i had was a debit card and the cost was under seven dollars she repeated five times that she did not want to process the order i was never warned in advance that the company can not process orders under 10 after stated a sixth time i told her do summers has no problem i a seven dollar purchase and left the premise is dingy and the service is awful consider this is a mom and pop establishment and they should be grateful to have clients in the shadow of larger dry cleaners|0
great staff and good quality product all around but i was coming to get my car battery tested and they were burned down so i went to the one on the other side of bell road on cave creek they do have other stores in the valley but this one looks like it will be closed for a while|1

these people are the worst i think they take advantage of the elderly in sun city who dont for the most part have a clue i went in there and was told i needed a new transmission to the tune of 2500 my car wasnt going into ith gear after i had the work done my car still wasnt going into ith gear and i was told oh its not the transmission now its the computer sensor another 1300 i checked with two other places and they said right it is the computer sensor thing but no way did i need a new transmission i was ripped off for 2500 i contacted them and they refused to do anything about it never again and twice they told my mom she had a leaky water pump and she knew that wasnt it and it wasnt total ripoff|0
youve got to realize i do not give five stars unless i am really satisfied i am not generous when it comes to rating places ive been i do expect a lot from establishments that i go to especially when i pay them my hard earned money just because not all of us were born with silver spoon in their mouth some of us need to work hard for it this spa gives me just exactly what i want need and then some i came here for my birthday last year my dearest of gave a sweet surprise and he made sure that i am all pampered and relaxed before he takes me to dinner that same night oh my gosh its feels so good that i do not even want to go the staff are nice and friendly you see i have to use those two words because theres huge difference between the two one place can be nice but not friendly and one place can be just friendly but not nice oh i hope you concur anyway after that first experience you can imagine that i will be back right oh yes i did and i will keep coming back as long as i get the same treatment janet pretty sweet janet buffed and filed my nail into perfect square none of the places that i have been gave me that i say none stephen well at least thats what i remember his name was gave me a massage that i have been looking for ages ago you know when it feels soooo good that you just want to give a soft moan just because you can not explain the pain and pleasure that your e going under but i controlled myself because i dont know how loud i could be i dont want to scare other people that might pass by the room that i was in michelle gave me the nicest scrub and oh boy i just didnt want her to stop i can get use to that kind of pampering i dont mind once a month oh yes please hahaha this place is a must try they cater to both sexes you wont feel op if your e a man|1

these are not friendly people i dont know what it is about wholesale sports but they either deliberately employee ignoramuses or its just coincidence that this type of store attracts hillbillies looking for work its really a pity because the store offers a great selection of merchandise and often has great promotions going on what troubled me most was how personally the staff seem to take it when your e using coupons in store manufacturer rebates price match policy they make it seem like theyre taking the hit personally for any discount they have to offer it truly makes for a frustrating experience dont blame the customer for being thrifty theyre just being a smart shopper oh and be wary of the neanderthals that work at the firearms counter dont you dare ask them for any assistance this according to them is akin to high treason finally it doesnt help that the cashier didnt seem too interested in doing her job either since the final buck stops with her asking her for a price match was like asking her to do the impossible and wow did the attitude come with it bottom line you pay peanuts you get monkeys|0
food is ok here there was a fly in my girlfriends pho and they didnt really care yeah not coming back|0
theyve been putting a lot of effort into promoting and i decided to give them a try this morning i got a bacon egg breakfast burrito that i had to throw out the bacon was almost exclusively giant chunks of fat and there was nothing in the burro other than the bacon and eggs positively inedible and im not usually all that picky why 2 stars the tortilla and salsa were great go figure|0

my mom boyfriend and brother stopped in to get shoes we found many styles we liked and the sales representatives were very helpful after buying shoes we realized we did not have the correct shoes and returned right before closing to get the correct size when we came back the manager realized we had left the correct pair on the counter and sorted the whole situation out refunding our purchase for the shoes she was very helpful and had a great attitude and had a great experience|1
this was my first time and ill never return again i told the lady i had been growing my eyebrows out for a while and they were still filling in due to a bad brow job i stressed i didnt like thin eyebrows and i busted wanted them cleaned up for mothers day what did she do thin brows i purchased the package called first date which included my brows and lashes the lashes were just as horrible too much freaking glue to the point it burned and my eyes were almost stuck and it began hurting because the glue dried and it was just sitting on my lids and the corner of eyes i asked her to clean glue and she told me from exp i needed to wait until following day because lash would come and couldnt be put back on needless to say i had to take them off because you could see the glue sitting on lashes also she kept insisting i purchase the package that would allow me to return for multiple services and i told her i dont come there enough i went to mac to have them fill my brows and i after i told the young lady my exp she even agreed that she jacked me up never again|0
i have used sals for two different services alteration and dry cleaning and have had different results first i took a pair of dress slacks in to get altered the employee was very helpful and asked many questions to make sure the pants would be altered the way i wanted i tried them on when i returned after they were altered and the fit great and looked great the second service is why i rated this business so low i took in 3 brand new never worn white dress shirts to be dry cleaned for my wedding all three shirts came back with stains on them and werent even pressed well she kept two of the shirts to bring them back in apparently the third one was good enough for her but is extremely unacceptable especially for an occasion as important as my wedding i can not wear this 60 shirt and i am definitely not taking it back only to return with more stains i had hoped when i first came to this business it was going to be my new spot with more personal service than an al phillips unfortunately for both of us the service and attention to detail on the dry cleaning will result in no more business from me|0
wouldve been great except for the fact that the staff was rude the atmosphere was cool love the lighting against the wall color bar is well stocked and cocktails are pretty good but the staff manager mainly was beyond rude while the band was playing making a scene about how bad they were even though everyone there loved them|0

i do not travel to this part of the county too often however when i do i will always stay here i come up for an annual conference therefore needing to rent a car and knowing all the time where one needs to go for food and entertainment can at times be daunting staying at this hotel is well worth the extra price you may pay being only a block from the tower and located on the very same street of most all the best restaurants in town this hotel is greatly situated also being that the conference is held at the fairgrounds having the tram pick you up and drop you off right in front of your hotel is priceless for the hotel itself its still a hotel however the staff is always attentive friendly and always willing to lend a hand the concierge desk is very good at what they do and make asking for anything a simple snap you would expect this at your ultra posh hotels but you are afforded this here as well plenty of restaurants in the hotel make not leaving the hotel during your stay a great option as well from a very nice bar to oyster shack to a sit down dinner you have it all right here at your finder tips the gym on the with floor is fantastic and the views are great as well although you may be spending a good amount of money for your hotel per night this is definitely the place to stay|1
if you care about your dog consider boarding them elsewhere the place is flea infested and the kennels are rarely cleaned based on the poop coat your dog will wear then you have the option to pay for a bath so you can take your dog home we were told by juan to never bring our dog back we will honor juans wish but he had a change of heart when my wife went in may be it was the 20000 she was about to pay and the sound of crickets and echoes in the vacant office must have brought him to his senses consider allowing your dog to chill alone at home and rely on animal survival skills and it will be better off i promise you there is a great need to provide a rating lower than 1 this will be the first 5 rating ever|0
how is this place still in business their gimmick is that they do noodles spanning many ethnicities and cuisines however i had hoped that they actually try to customize the noodle dishes to the tastes instead each noodle dish is assembled together noodles being the base and whatever ethnically appropriate veggies and meat are mixed in the problem is that noodles are not like say burritos in which mix and match assembly works noodles work only when the flavor is cooked into the noodles assembling it together like that results in predominantly bland noodles at best and their mac and cheese at worst the mac and cheese was literally a bowl of elbow pasta with store bought shredded cheese thrown on top and i know that its store bought there is no way that hand shredded cheese would curl in that distinctive and uniform way also unrelated to how their entire restaurant concept does not work they seem to skimp on the sauce i got what should be a simple and hard to screw up bowl of spaghetti and meatballs and they gave me a piddling amount of sauce just an overall exasperating experience|0

this place is awful from their unprofessional staff and horrible customer service to their unclean and unorganized counters i had a very bad time at this location if you have billing questions or concerns i would highly recommend going to another cox location cox always provides great internet service at a reasonable price but my experience with this location made me cancel my service with them its a shame may be in the future i will return to cox because of the high speed internet and low prices but i will definitely go to the rainbow location instead|0
we have rented a unit for just over 7 months after the first month we noticed the weather stripping was old and brittle and need to be replaced our stuff was totally covered in dirt i informed the office and they said someone would call us in the following 2 weeks after a month past i stopped by the office to enquire about our door getting fixed i was informed i have your complaint in the system and they should call you i let it go another few weeks or more and still heard nothing to make a long review shorter after being blown off once by the door repair guy and having to threaten to take my business elsewhere i hate doing that by the way the door for fixed on the with of june 6 months later to be fair the district manager have us a month of free rent but that was only after her arguing that we were only technically paying for the space not the door if thats not the worst customer service youve ever heard of at any rate i will not be using a storage one unit again they dont really care about the people they serve|0
this a small yet cozy and in it mate restaurant the owner is very personable he approached our table as if he had known us for years the food was superb but took a little longer to get to the table than expected but i guess perfection takes a little longer the eggs florentine poached to perfection and the sauce complimented it well the potatoes were outstanding and not overcooked the ham crepes great flavor and texture was nice the peach tartine was refreshing and the ingredients worked well together great flavors great ambience highly recommended|1
its never easy to say goodbye to a beloved pet there was no doubt that it was time to end monkeys suffering im thankful for five extra months with her which she might not have had without the staff at nor terra yesterday i brought my kitty to be euthanized ugh thats hard to write i knew in my head and heart this time that there was no out no taking monkey home with me i couldnt have asked for a kinder more compassionate gentler transition for her thanks to the staff at nor terra you would have thought monkey had lived with each of them for 19 years if i could climb pies tara peak without losing a lung or two i would shout from the summit that this is the best vet in the phoenix area instead i will have to do it from this desk lungs in tact and via yelp my cat fred who was a month from his with birthday when he was euthanized a few years ago was taken to another vet in scottsdale i hadnt yet found nor terra animal hospital i cringe at the memory although they were also kind and well intentioned the procedure did not go smoothly and it broke my heart saying goodbye is already stressful and unwelcome i couldnt have made a better choice than to bring my kitty here i will miss you monkey as i miss you fred thank you dry simons and horvath kelley kristen and everyone else who have given such good care to my geriatric friend|1

food was adequate however the service was the worst i have received in toronto in years they were slow and barely served us they were rude and sloppy it took 20 minutes to talk to a waitress and our food came 20 minutes or more apart from other people at our table who ordered at the same time i normally tip 20 for good service when we were leaving we left a poor tip due to the terrible service the manager tried to claim there was a minimum of 15 tip in canada and was very rude she immediately ran over to a table of her friends by the door and talked trash about us and tried to intimidate us as we left and now i leave my first negative review as a warning|0

ive been eating hagen days at biltmore fashion square since i was teeny rum raisin to be specific yes even when i was teeny i was a foodie with some interesting taste buds its a little different than it was when i was in high school in 198 cough cough a while back then my friends and i used to pile into my parents valiant and spill out hot and hungry headed for rum raisin and giggling and gossip outside while we watched the moneyed preppy boys go by but its still good i like getting my hagen days not out of a carton in the grocery store|1
let me start by saying i am a very mild temper patient person and while id like to give this place the benefit of doubt my experience here was horrible i had a fan that crapped out on my in my vain computer i ordered a new fan from sony i heard that vamos are notorious for being difficult to repairs so i called a bunch of places asking do you have experience with vain computers this is the series of events that took place them yes we work with them all the time to replace the fan will only be an hour of labor me so you have experience with vamos yes we work with them all the time 2 days later them it will actually take us two hours worth of labor to install the new fan because your computer is more complicated then we thought 2 days after that did your sound work when you dropped it off me yes them ok we are going to need a couple of days to trouble shoot and figure out why the sound isnt working anymore 2 days after that we broke a clamp that connects your sound card to your motherboard and have to order a new part this will take 45 days to come in 5 days after that i finally get a call to come pick up my computer i bring it home and find out the keyboard has not be installed back to its proper position i call and express my frustrations and they say ok bring it in and we will fix it on the spot i bring it in sit in the lobby for 30 min while they try and fix it it looks good so i go home i turn my computer on and find out that half the keys arent working they havent charged me for anything except for the fan installation but the whole process will have taken over three weeks now as apposed to the 23 days for the fan installation furthermore they havent offered any discounts or compensation or even shown remorse in fact i expressed my frustrations again in person and they guy at the counter was like yeah there is no discount we can give you i can have the repair guy come and talk to you gee thanks forced remorse always makes me feel great all in all if they were just honest in the begining that they did have experience with these types of computers and may be they actually seemed like they felt bad about how much of a pain in the ass they have been i would have been able to give them the benefit of doubt but there is no doubt now they totally suck|0
i had a great experience my first time at salon car amid today after a terrible haircut years ago going to the hairdresser still makes me pretty anxious kiera took amazing care of me she took the time to understand exactly what i wanted and if i wasnt sure about a certain aspect exact length textures or layers she went gradually so that i was really comfortable with the whole process and the cut is excellent i will definitely be back|1
i was recently taken to this wonderful hidden gem its a small neighborhood bar with a cozy appeal the owners son chadwick has taken over the management and one can tell he is enjoying it it has a quaint patio out back if your e looking for cheap domestic beers and shots this is your place after 10pm especially a pint of domestic beer is 2 be ready for the millennial crowd if your looking for craft beers this is not necessarily your place but they do have cincinnati rein i heist brewery i truth on tap for 4 a pint as well as some great lakes brewery bottles there is a party room in the back that is free to reserve as long as you order the beer and spirits from the bar food is not served but you are welcome to bring it in party room or not this is definitely an establishment that speaks to my pocketbook i will be back|1
so just so everyone knows this place recently underwent significant changes no more 650 all day menu most of the reviews here are referring to the old setup and menu of this restaurant the former owners of king i on maryland are helping out the owner of this place and the new menu is identical to king i including dishes prices and even font so your e looking to pay around 10 for an entree at dinner time they do have a lunch menu with entree fried rice and spring roll for 650750 depending on meat like king i the food is delicious good portions lots of flavor the inside of this place is teeny tiny with just a few tables but its a great option for take out or delivery delivery fee is 2 overall if you like king i youll like this place its good food for a pretty decent price and its the best option in this area|1
the food here seems like it is precooked always dry or overcooked may be even microwaved wings are awful they cook way too many in advance hot dogs are always burnt and over done i asked the cashier if their onions rings were home made she said she did not know what that meant i told her it meant they peeled cut them and battered them in the restaurant and deep fried them she stated yeah we cook them here so yes they are home made no idiot that is not home made food seems to run well when management is there but when the cat is away the mice really do not give rats ass about the food or the customers|0
customer service was good the two ladies working were very nice i had a large pepperoni pizza and garlic bread the pizza crust and garlic bread dough tasted more like bread dough than pizza dough almost sweet it did have a nice fluffy texture however the marinara sauce was very bland the cheese was delicious though not good enough to go back unfortunately|0

we were celebrating our 5 year anniversary and wanted something good simple this is not what we received on our plates my fianc ordered the coz sirloin medium well with steamed broccoli and pan seared mashed potatoes and i ordered the sizzling fajitas with shrimp chicken along with 2 salads i ranch dressing when the fajitas came out sizzling my mouth watered i truly love green peppers and onions i could tell the chicken strips were cold when i looked at them because they looked as if they came straight out the freezer i pulled one off my plate and it was cold did i mention is came out sizzling my fianc i steak was fully cooked and tasted like cardboard i called the waiter over to the table and asked him to touch the chicken strip and he apologized and got the manager the manager came over and i asked him to feel the strips also he admitted they were cold he offered to remake the food but it wouldve put us behind on other things we had planned so we declined i couldnt event finish my meal and neither could my fianc so we boxed our things and left my frustration is we ended up leaving and going to another restaurant later and spending twice what we planned with to days economy i only go to places that deliver on what they offer there was no reason for me to blow money on something i was not able to consume we took the food and fed it to our dogs when we got home the next day|0
not anymore 20 minutes to check out as only the self checkouts were open and available 5 people cruising around in front of the closed person operated registers but no manned register opened for over 15 minutes 25 people waiting in line behind 6 who were at the self checkout wif its sunday evening too many people in line and whomever is in charge does not have someone open a register by the time i got to the self checkout the ice cream i came to get was pretty much a waste i paid for milk oj and broccoli but left the ice cream while you are the closest to home you are certainly not the best you have lost my business|0

originally i loved this store ive bought almost everything for my 8 month old daughter either from carters online or from this carters on october 3 though i bought a cute little dressy dress for my daughter from this carters intending for her to wear it for pictures i always wash baby clothes before putting my daughter in them and this dress actually said wash before wearing on the tag i washed it two days later on the delicate cycle in a front loading washer in a lingerie bag i dried it still in the lingerie bag when i took it out to hang it up the tie on the dress had a giant rip right along the seam i was disappointed but figured they would take it back and id just get a new one and hope that it didnt rip in the wash too obviously my daughter never even wore the dress i returned to the store today october 6 to return it the same clerk who sold me the dress was working there and actually remembered me i told her exactly what happened she checked with her manager in the back who advised that since the item had been washed i may have torn it myself and they would not take it back i stood there confused initially and tried to explain to her what happened again she reiterated that they simply will not take an item back if it has been washed she suggested that may be i should try sewing it together myself or using some kind of iron thing to put the seam back together i had intended to buy more bodysuits and other things for my baby on this trip since i was there anyway but was hesitant to buy anything there again after that i rarely return anything unless something like this happens you wash it once and it falls apart i really didnt expect them to simply refuse to exchange it buyer beware this store wont stand by their products and will pretty much tell you to go i yourself if you have a problem ill find somewhere else to buy baby clothes|0

great products however this store location has the absolute worst service looking for something specific i asked the sale associate where i might find it she pointed off into massive amounts of products in the store i finally found what i was looking for but wanted it in a hand cream i continued to scour the store went back to her post which apparently she was not going to budge from i showed her the product that i was searching for in a hand cream she just pointed into the store what the really so i said ohhs this is a scavenger hunt i feel sorry for this poor girl|0

i cant even give them one star i understand my credit situation isnt spectacular but they put me into the biggest piece of shit ive ever driven i purchased in december of 2013 and at that time it appeared to drive well but as ive used it the past almost 2 years its been nothing but trouble bad ball joints tires that rot out rusted floorboards i now believe this piece of junk was a former salvage vehicle from a flood most likely katrina this is partially my fault because i didnt follow the buyer beware caveat shame on me but shame on them for preying on credit challenged people trying to buy a decent used vehicle do not go here please|0
service is horrible staff are usually quite rude the only ones who actually pay attention to you are the cooks when you walk in i ordered from here for my break got told it would be 1520 minute wait so i didnt take my break until it should have been ready i got there and my sushi was sitting on the counter but waited 20 minutes until the rest of my order was ready wish i hadnt paid before i got my food because there would have been zero tip my sushi was mushy and cold it was tempura so it shouldve been warm honestly not worth the money to get treated like crap by the employees and have such gross food ive given this place far too many chances this was the last one its a great location wish they would try harder to keep their customers happy though|0
best but in am all the location on the second floor got revamped into a beautiful fruity oasis and is very much underrated fruity doesnt have the 2 for 1 deal like many other but places in am all but the quality of the drinks is worth the extra money starts at 55 i got a large read huge mango coconut sago to share and it was so fresh and refreshing a large is more than enough for two people and if it only cost us 725 i think its a much better deal than the 2 for 1 deals elsewhere the stand out about fruity is that they actually use real fruits and milk instead of the powder artificial stuff used frequently by competitors i watched them put fresh slices of mango and boxed coconut milk into the vitamin if you stick your head over the counter you can get a whiff of the sweet fresh fruit aromas do note that this is more of a fruit vegetable smoothies lush fresh juice joint with the option to add your typical but toppings tapioca aloe sago you wont find your original tea or taro flavours here but if your e in the mood for fruit based drinks like mango watermelon lychee berries or even durian give this place a try instead come to fruity and make your next but less of a guilty pleasure but rather a dose of your daily fruit and vegetables made delicious|1

i just moved to the cuyahoga falls area from out of state and was looking for a new home nail salon this place had great reviews online so i decided to give it a shot the pedicure was pretty standard however the technician botched the polish job and he did not even clean up the edges of polish that was left on the skin i requested a regular manicure with gel polish after applying 3 coats of the gel polish my nails looked like a toddler had painted them very uneven and thick the technician removed the gel polish which anyone who has had gel before knows that is not a quick easy feat he tried to scrape it off initially which again anyone who has gel manicures regularly knows that will scrape off a layer of your nails i had to ask that he soak it off after finally removing the botched gel and picking a new color he applied the new color to the first finger and i could tell it was going to be just as bad perhaps this salon does not replace their polish regularly or store it properly or perhaps this technician was not educated in the job regardless i was there for over 2 hours and walked out with a very expensive pedicure and half way done manicure i asked him to stop and not apply anymore polish to my nails all for the bargain price of 40 to be read as extremely over priced back to searching for a new regular salon|0

i wish i could give this place a better review since all ive heard about from friends were positive experiences mine was not i think it really depends on the person helping you and how busy the space is i initially went in to tune up the brakes on my bike the cable housings had somehow broken in some spots and it was near impossible to come to a complete stop using brakes alone after asking the guy helping me how to go about fixing it he squeezed the levers to show me that my brakes did indeed work failing to realize that there is a difference between the bike being stationary and the brakes appearing to work and then having the bike in motion with a load applied to the system when i asked if the broken housing was a problem he didnt answer and asked if i had anything else to fix i mentioned that sometimes my derailer shifted the chain off the gears entirely and he told me that was impossible he then suggested that i oil some parts of my bike so all i ended up doing was lubing some parts of my bike and none of the major problems that i had come in to fix were addressed the oiling required some disassembly and when i asked him if he could show me the correct way to put everything back he snapped well im not going to do it for you at that point i could see it was going nowhere thanked him for his help and left id be very hesitant to go back unless there was a specific tool i wanted to use however looking around it did seem like other people were having better experiences than i|0
two times now my boyfriend and i have went to this location both times the door sign says open lights are on and doors are locked the first time we encountered this we stood outside and called 3 times hoping someone would pick up which no one did second time before showing up we called from home a lady picks up and says theyll be opening in 15 minutes so we hop in the car drive to danforth keep in mind this is about 30 mins later we get there lights are on door sign says open and bam door is locked called again and no answer who knows what the issue was perhaps whomever was working had to step out coincidentally both times but at least could have had the proper courtesy as a business to put a sign up on the door will not attempt to go there again and judging from these reviews the place is a shit hole|0

i had a horrible experience i have been tanning here for a few months now when tanning you press the start button today my tanning bed wouldnt start apparently the black button was turned off which i had never been shown to check to make sure it was on i lost out on 3 minutes of my 8 minute tan the little man working there wouldnt even look up from his cell phone and said there was nothing he could do about it when i asked for the managers name and number or when she would be working he replied ummm ummm sorry cant tell you i told him i have paid a lot of money to tan here and will not be treated this way and i told him to not get an attitude with me he said ummm who is the one with an attitude you need to get rid of this guy or learn how teach your employees to be professional i would cancel my tanning package if i could be refunded i will not buy another tanning package after my last tan is used i will go somewhere else who offers great customer service and is willing to help their customers you would think with the downfall of the economy employees would be helpful rather than ignorant and immature so disappointed and such an unprofessional man update 06042012 i spoke to the acting manager and she was so nice and professional she helped resolve my issue i will continue to tan here thanks to employees who offer great customer service|0
every sunday afternoon you will likely find me wandering the aisles of this nice hidden gem in the middle of the mcgill ghetto a great mix of imported food organic veggie products and asian food there is also a sandwich counter which i have yet to try i dont actually find this store that particularly expensive for the quality of products available with a little bit of self control my grocery bill turns out to be less expensive than going to say metro or 4 frees you also get higher quality products as previously mentioned you only need to complete your groceries and buy your meat and non edibles elsewhere|1
starters 3 dozen oysters 1 per oyster not too bad but definitely not as fresh as places like biff i bistro then we had the fois gras on crostini it tasted of nothing and the fois gras had the texture of an overcooked meat it was so small and it costed 1750 what the we also got soups lobster bisque russian borscht and cream soup everything is way too salty lobster bisque was very fishy not a lot of lobster taste we had the 4 person meal 100 in my opinion way too expensive had spaghetti with cream sauce with seafood pork foot steak with mashed potatoes and fish with vegetables quality of everything was ok steak was very chewy we asked for medium but we basically got well done then spaghetti was way too salty service was good but the servers really try to rush to get the plates back its great if we have more food coming but if feels like they stand there to get us to finish the dish so that they can use the dish again for other guests in a way im being brutally honest with my opinions salt is definitely needed to enhance the flavor of the dish however too much salt just overpowers the flavors that is put into the dish would i be back only if i need to be|0

the management is nice the grounds are pretty and well kept the rent is really affordable the apartments themselves are another matter the buildings are really old so they are in constant need of maintenance since moving here in november i have been without heat for a few days been without ac for a few days and ive been without hot water for a total of 7 days of the past month there are two holes in my ceiling where there was a leak during the first 4 day stretch without hot water that have been patched but not finished so it looks tacky when we moved in the fridge was leaking the heat and ac werent working there was a fire in the ceiling the first time we turned on the heat the toilet was leaking constantly i had no working plugs for the tub or any of the sinks and the lid to the top of the toilet didnt fit that still hasnt been replaced my tub needs to be re caulked everything ive asked them to fix eventually got fixed i have just gone too long without hot water and ac in particular what is really out of hand to me is the hot water today is day 7 of no hot water i have received no apologies from the office and no discussion of compensation since this has gone on so long i understand that things fall apart thats why i have put up with so much but the water heater is the last straw no one that works here has expressed any apology over what has gone on except for one maintenance man named raul he is an amazing guy and i have a feeling he is not appreciated here i will not be renewing my lease here when it is up at the end of october i would not recommend this place to anyone|0

i didnt expect much when i walked into nando place was really nice and spacious a little confusing when it comes to ordering staff told us to take a table and a menu pick something and order it from the counter and then it will be full service with the amount of staff they have on the floor mind as well have a full table service so the staff can get tipped properly and we wont have to walk to the counter to order food was really good we ordered chicken thigh chicken wings and french fries to share we ordered it mild since i cant handle spicy but my brother asked for some spicy sauce on the side and he loved it portion was good and service was lovely will come back for sure|1
this place is amazing i love persian food and this place has food on top of food on top of food and it was so delicious i came from out of town and this supermarket was down the street from my hotel it was late and we were looking for a yummy home cooked meal without all the fuss we found exactly what we were looking for here pricing is a little high but they make up for it in the amount of food given to you and the quality taste i wish i had something like this back home if i lived in toronto this would definitely would be my go to spot excellent market|1

went at lunch on labour day and the service was fast with plenty of available seating i got the small steak this time but ive gotta say its pretty much as big as the large the ingredients were fresh and had a good amount of meat i also got the chips multi coloured tortilla chips and i was reminded that they arent good at all there is no flavour at all and you are only given a tiny container of salsa which was good for less than half the chips overall all these fast food burrito places are pretty much the same|1

while on the strip looking for a place to drink we were approached and said there is a cover 20 but drinks are free we thought why not we were there pretty early so it wasnt that packed until later in the night this place is relatively small even when it isnt busy and the free drinks didnt have much alcohol in them that was disappointing although since we were pretty sloshed anyway we considered getting a tattoo here luckily one of us had some rational sense and left before getting inked all of the designs we had picked out were whims anyway|0
this is an update on my review to let you know my hair feels like wire and its almost to the point of breaking my hair was not like this when i went in color is over processed and the toner the manager applied is all gone you can tell where they realized the mistake they cut this top layer of blonde way way short leaving me with almost a mullet like cap of fried burnt blonde please avoid this place for color incompetency at all costs i had a bad experience with one of the stylists and the salon itself so i will not be back that is not to say all of the techs are the same for you i hope the location is convenient its true about things being sold out often in the store side for the salon side i am not sure if i will ever be back for 2 reasons 1 the shampoo bowls are not at the proper level to rinse your hair and extremely uncomfortable i am petite at 54 and i think i have dislocated my back from this also there is no water pressure to rinse out your color you would think ultra being a large chain could fix this and last but not least 2 not listening to the desired result for color and cut both i got a very amateur stylist color was flying including onto my face i paid a lot of money for a 3 hour job with not a lot of thought given to the placement of the color and a rush job on the cut artistic level zero i came in with a level 11 light blonde framing my face and crown and asking to be blended in with level 4 on top for a result of level 7 on blonde and deposit blonde on top of grey at the root line the key words being blended and level 7 this person did not hear those instead another stylist came along to voice her opinion just basically disrupting the plan i had just laid out so this person and the other made the decision about my hair and applied full level 4 on the lower part of my hair for a full 45 minutes stating that this was necessary due to greys if you leave level 4 on for 45 minutes you get level 4 not level 7 i had some grey yes but only at the roots so 45 minutes on the entire bottom was excessive as this part of my hair was already darker coming in when i turned to one of the other technicians 30 minutes in to ask about the time she said color is just color it will just process cookie cutter color here she didnt care meanwhile my technician was nowhere to be found probably off having dinner and came back with cigarette smoke smell dont you think it is professional to check your color from time to time especially if there is bleach being used more blonde had been applied in other places which just damaged my already light hair there wasnt anything blended about the darker color it was applied almost entirely to just one half of my head and the cut was just an aforethought i was left overly short and blonde on top and long and dark on bottom with some dark round spots on top of my blonde and color on my face i had to go back another day for correction and recut and waste more of my time sitting on top of already a 3 hour waste yes my hair was difficult with greys at the root but this result is not what i would expect even at a beauty school root touch ups means retouching just at the root i can not recommend it is the worst salon experience in my life i came in on a 25 off plus a deal for monday night i did not see the 25 off on my receipt and it was not cheap i can only recommend the manager she was kind enough to attempt to fix both the color and cut as best as she could i was trying to grow my hair longer and i have a lot of really short layers on top that is going to take forever to grow back like i had it those short layers are because they fried my hair and tried to cut out their mistake never again|0
sent here by my insurance company geiko for self inflicted front end damage and also by the insurance company of a driver who rear ended me on a separate event same day excalibur staff helped coordinate seamlessly the communication and repairs for me with both insurance claims and also with enterprise car rental they sent a representative there with a bow for me i was happy i didnt have to go to a separate location to deal with the loaner paperwork easy convenient everyone was helpful and friendly and made this stressful experience a lot easier than i thought it would be quick quotes quick thorough repairs and i was pleased to find that they had detailed my lexus inside and out before i arrived to pick up my car zero complaints and highly recommended|1
now kay i food was average but absolutely the worst service i have ever seen at no point should a server be yelling at a customer especially when its just a few guys wanting to grab a quick bite before going home also the owner was there and ignored the situation a couple of friends and i decided to grab a quick bite after being out for a buddys birthday my friend asked for a glass of water with his food waitress says they dont serve glasses of water walks away surprised my friend asked her why when she came around again she ignores him a second waitress came by my friend asked her very politely why they did not serve glasses of water she walked away without a sound stormed back a minute later yelling at my friend called him an asshole slammed a bottle of water down then walked away shocked my friend didnt know how to react then 5 mins later the first waitress came back grabbed the bottle of water the other waitress slammed own and walked away with it we waved the owner over wanting to resolve any misunderstanding he said his waitress did not call him an asshole in fact he only heard her saying if you are going to be an asshole because apparently if you put if in front of an insult its not an insult so if kay i has such terrible service how come there are others with similar reviews about their bad service your service is horrific and the food is only average compared to the many sher warm ad on air shops in the area|0

i last paid a visit to this mcdonalds about a month ago and ordered breakfast though it wasnt busy the cashier took us to a kiosk and said she her manager wants patrons to use the machine instead of ordering at the register because they are quicker this was the second time this has happened and now we dont go back part of the experience of going to this mcdonalds are the nice cashiers and interacting with them especially when its not so busy in the morning|0

i dont often write reviews and when i do i like to keep them positive but after my recent experience with my tight face i felt compelled to share the following information with the consumer i left a message for them because i wanted to inquire about specific services one day later a lady from the front desk called me i was inquiring about a specific service endermologie when i inquired about types of services they offered for facial tightening the receptionist had no answers became defensive and addressed me with combativeness when i asked her why she was being so rude she put me on hold and another lady answered the phone i proceeded to ask her questions about a specific machine for which i wanted to book a service the new endermologie machine from france she said that the information was confidential and she could not share it with me and less i went into their place of business for a consultation i replied that if they had the machine i would book an appointment on the spot but she too became very defensive and insisted that it was confidential really im out i told her with that type of an attitude i wouldnt take an appointment there for free|0
good seats best soulless place to watch a movie just like where you are from your standard theater|1
the rooftop patio is breathtaking almost a 360 view of the city but this review is for the meal and service that we received we went for lunch on a sunday during soft opening and i was very disappointed i ordered a baleen dive beet salad that sounded delicious but when i got the salad it was literally just a small plate of overdressed kale leaves with a few two one sized beet chips and endive chips which tasted like salt when i expressed how unhappy i was with the salad our waitress said she would talk to the chef and when she came back she apologized but said there was nothing she could do i thought she could at least offer a comp i meal i just resigned to eating the salad as is however the waitress brought a plate of beets when i was almost finished and said the manager ok i it through the paying and leaving process she didnt even acknowledge us or say thank you not a pleasant nor impressive experience beautiful hotel but like the other reviewers i hope they work out their kinks going forward|0
the restaurant is actually called blossom inn and used to be a very hip place to dine in the is is the do or sure hasnt changed since then i liked this place on and off since moving to this area 7 years ago we seem to give it another chance every 6 months since the management changed 2 years ago the food we had was as follows chicken balls were over cooked too much batter and a tiny piece of chicken the beef and broccoli was good the beef was tender and the broccoli was crunchy it was hot and the sauce was spiced just right they used to do a dried crispy beef dish there called blossom beef the owner was very proud of this it was good but the new people cant prepare it at all it seemed a lazy attempt the beef was cut too big no julienned carrots and the sauce was a i loopy sweet mess the cantonese chow mien and steamed rice were average im not really a fan of this place to be honest|0
this is such a great place to eat but try to go at an off time at the popular times they still serve you well etc but i just like to go for a relaxed meal on a friday recently we made sure to go before up and it was so nice we had a relaxing meal and the food was awesome my husband had a nice thick swordfish steak and i had the chicken mushroom crepes yum my martini was the best ive had in a long long time|1

this is my favorite location ive gone to this store for years because i stay on the east side i went in one morning right when they opened to buy a long sleeve and 99 of the employees in encountered were rude the one in the fitting room didnt greet me or even attempt to be nice then i went to the home decor section and one of the employees was there and she was mad she kept talking to herself and cussing about how much she hated working there it made me feel uncomfortable to even shop in that area i felt as if i were to grab or touch something she would get mad then i went to check out and they called all associates to the front to have a meeting and the only person i encountered that was nice was the cashier i think her name was key ara and she was really nice overall horrible customer service at that location|0

very responsive took the time to walk the yard and listen to my concerns with the existing system they explained the differences i the materials they uses is what i was buying from home depot their products were commercial grade thicker pipes better distribution etc it took a few days longer than expected but it was very very hot and they guys got over heated not really an issue but he communicated with me about it and showed concern for his workers ive been very happy so far and they did exactly what they said they were going to do highly recommend|1

avoid this place at all cost it has the worse service imaginable they also like to do certain procedures on you without letting you know that they will charge you up the ass for it later on|0

went in after seeing the cute signage on the store window while driving along funds bought dessert to take to our neighbours house for a biq caramel cheesecake oh my gawd this cake was beyond just being sweet i dont think i ate anything sweet for 2 weeks after indulging in this cheesecake and swore to myself that i would not buy it again then the unthinkable happened my neighbour and i decided to give this bakery another chance and went and ordered our daughters birthday cakes what a freaking disaster the cakes were not ready on time and the butter cream icing with raspberry flavour wasnt iced on the cakes but just plain old vanilla butter cream icing oooh duh if we wanted plain old vanilla butter cream icing we would have requested that so the bottom line is that we are not going back thank you for trying but no thanks|0
don gis quickly became our go to pizza delivery spot when we moved to old brooklyn their crust and cheese are especially delicious we typically go for supreme and sausage or ham and pineapple but everything we have tried so far has been really good we were shocked to find that even their salads are worth trying made with fresh ingredients and hearty any time our parents come into town they ask for us to have don gis on standby if you live in the area you i be remiss not to try it|1
honestly the place was clean service was amazing hence the 3 star everyone was on time i received a crown and had to get it shaved down from the sensitivity couple weeks later now its still hurting been couple months was told it might be a root canal now still cant chew on this side so ill have to go back again may be get a and opinion just in case update after writing this review the manager contacted me and took me in right away to analyze what was going on do clearly explained everything to me and compared my two rays i appreciated that it was all shown and explained to me i need a root canal due to my old filling being very deep and causing nerve sensitivity do explained that once i received root canal he will redo and fix my crown at no charge thank you|1
great local pizza joint tried both their plain cheese and white pizza which were both very good they have a great crust with an original taste not just another generic local pizza chain they were just a little light on the sauce for my liking overall really enjoyed the pizza will definitely be back|1
used to be pretty good 67 year ago service and quality has since taken a turn for the worse ive stayed here probably 100 nights over the last 7 years not so anxious to say any more last stay and probably last ever was nov 2014 rear door opens from rear parking lot to elevator banks leaves from outside had blown in and were scattered throughout elevator lobby for the entire duration of my stay 3 days asked for a wake up call both nights of my stay didnt happen either morning residence inns are primarily for business travelers wake up calls can be important be professional when i came down the second morning noticed that the front desk was unmanned and the only employee around was making breakfast in the dining area perhaps she was meant to do the wake up calls wrote to manager to inform them of the issues in the hope that they be remedied manager apologized and offered to credit my marriott awards account with extra points to make up for the poor service two weeks later still no points followed up got another apology from same manager now into second week of january still no points emailed manager for status report no response not the level of service im accustomed to from marriott given how often i and the company i am part owner of use marriott hotels will certainly be on the alert for alternatives to residence inn whitby and unfortunately now not as confident in the residence inn brand|0
i have fond memories of the happi inn because it reminded me of rat pack vegas with the mirrored ceiling and shag carpet just ironic without trying decent rates and yes it was showing its age great location across from mandalay bay and near the klondike casino you saw in chevy chases las vegas the one with the weird games like war funny thing is after the movie everyone kept asking for war so some casinos started dealing it|1

safety not a concern we bought a bow from jack and ryan i dealt with ryan over phone and email because we live in ca so later i find out i called and emailed too much i guess well buying that car and spending that kind of money we wanted to know as much as possible in detail as we were flying over and driving back home test drive was ok i had said how are the tires ryan says they are ok they arent brand new but they seem to be fine well he said their guys had checked out the car had his service department checked this car out they would have seen the bubble i spotted in the front tire he discounted 200 and said be sure you get a new tire before you drive back we stayed the night so ended up driving around a bit in doing so rubber starts flying off going down the freeway this happened 3 times it was sat afternoon on labor day weekend bow dealers were closed and service wouldnt be open again until tues we needed 4 new run flat tires which arent stocked in most tire shops so we bought 2 other tires thankfully we made it home on sunday my biggest gripe is they knew that car needed tires more than we did and they knew we had almost 400 miles to drive our safety wasnt even considered and thats not ok|0

last year we had our house painted by badger painting they helped us pick the colors were very flexible i know i said not to paint the deck but now ive decided id like you to paint the deck provided great advice how far down do you think we should paint the foundation and always responded to emails and phone calls very promptly naturally i called them when we wanted additional work done this year but i was shocked to discover that badger painting has closed on the other hand i am delighted to be told that krug bros is employing many of the staff used by badger painting we are looking forward to having krug come out|1
the cashier was very rude the soda machine was broken so my son and i got soda from the refrigerator and got ice from the soda machine the cashier was charging us 170 for the ice in the cup i told him it was not my fault that their machine was broken and i shouldnt be charged for the ice but he didnt listen he was really very rude and im surprised why he is still working there|0
we were out visiting my parents from no and looking for a place to eat after seeing the museum of natural history the place was still brand new but it had so many great reviews that we stopped in i had the chicken and vegetable hash the brussels sprouts and sweet potato were perfectly browned the chicken appeared to have been slow cooked and shredded and also had just the right amount of browning to make the edges slightly crispy while still retaining juiciness the egg was also cooked perfectly and i got that molten yolk dripping down into the dish when i put the edge of my fork into it if i lived in mesa id have that for breakfast all the time my daughter had the grilled cheese it was a little fancy compared to what she normally thinks of as grilled cheese but she thoroughly enjoyed it the in house potato chips are killer i see a lot of reviews commenting on portion size and price while i dont disagree i would add that there is value in the quality of ingredients they are obviously using here also i was shocked that bottled water was on the house so theres that i will definitely stop in every time im in mesa|1
this is my first house honestly i had no experience for buying the house at all first i went to chase bank the chase bank the way they talked to me i was feeling i got house but after spending few weeks they said sorry you missing this and that i told them back what was all about spending my time finally my agent told me go to the this company nice people respectful open communication pleasantries solving problems they worth it for your time thank you for all your hard working guys|1

worst bank ever its almost 3 weeks and i still dont have my car title i gave them a cashiers check not a personal check to pay off the car loan they say it is standard to hold on to the check for 10 days really a cashiers check from a very large well known bank then come to find out they got my zip code wrong even though they were taking my address straight from my license and are refusing to do anything about it with the mad somehow they got it right on other paperwork but not the important mad stuff so now it is my problem to correct it with the mad and to fix their mistake if they cant handle getting a zip code right or how to handle cashiers checks do you really want them handling your money not to mention their poor customer service by refusing to lift a finger to rectify their mistake|0

im sure ill catch a lot of flack for this review but that means very little to me what i love about yelp is that one has the freedom so long as you keep it clean to write whatever you want about a person place or thing some people take offense to a review and theyll let you know about but i like that i like to stir the pot ive always thought of express as the outlet store for guess they havent done anything to sway my opinion in the last 12 years and after one visit ive yet to find fault in my logic i used to shop at express in my early is at that time it reminded me of grown up guido clothes mind you i thought timberland boots a pair of hillier khakis and a polo sweater was go i havent been inside of an express to shop for myself in years but this time i was on vacation so i thought of giving express a shot same terrible clothes only now they make terrible shirts 70 off selected items even if it was free i wouldnt wear it yuck on the bright side their associates provided great customer service i may have been approached by the manager or assistant manager he was informative but not overbearing and he kept the sale floor immaculate but its still express|0

went in very excited to have our first professional family photos taken the studio took wonderful pictures they were patient with my 6 month old and even got a lot of smiles but when it came time to pick out a photo package things changed i was told over the phone that the average package was 100 and that came with a photo ad in reality the 100 package is really 129 and comes with an encrypted ad so we are unable to print our own photos this should have been disclosed over the phone very disappointed i feel like we got swindled|0
thieves billed 3000 for nothing said i got level 3 care but the doctor looked at me for literally 1 minute tops prescribed antibiotics and pain meds and that was it the pain meds did nothing and i had to get something else from the dentist 10 hours later when they opened only used 2 why not just give me 2 that work and not 24 that dont they prescribed antibiotics that were six more spend than needed to be the dentist said corporate healthcare for profit makes me so sick and sad for this country how can we let this be legal we have things in the world that run non profit and instead we subsidize tanks missiles and war with our tax dollars but healthcare is for profit who ever owns this hospital does not care about you|0
horrible service i waited almost half an hour for 4 drinks the place is also very messy it seems as though no one ever cleans this place i do not recommend this mcdonalds never coming back|0
admittedly i am a little sensitive ticklish during my pedicures but this place was ridiculous it was the least relaxing pedicure ive ever had and i felt like i was getting attacked on top of that the finished product looked like something i could do myself their color selection was poor they had almost no magazines and they charged almost 50 for a manic edi this was my first and last trip to crystal nails|0
this and any dunking donuts has now become my 1 destination for iced coffee i use to be a dutch bros faithful and forget about overpriced starbucks too this is the spot service here is always pretty fast|1
dont waste your money with these guys we gave them a pretty easy thing to do simply find out where somebody works on facebook the person said they were working we had the name of the person the address the social security previous employer and gave all that to them no secret agent stuff or following the person all they had to do was check records for information we paid them 350 up front as they requested after 10 days we got nothing in return oh yeah they confirmed the address we gave them ha ha no rebate nothing what a waste of money not at all what we expected|0
literally every person on the staff is awesome they take you on a tour of the facility the first time you are there which i didnt really understand but whatever they use walkie talkies and ear pieces to communicate so you dont end up waiting around they are huge on positive reinforcement oh im so proud of you or your e doing good the have new tech and utilities that make procedures much easier and they are totally informative with everything they do awesome awesome awesome|1
this place was very cute and quaint love that it is family owned more of a pub typed place not very kid friendly there isnt a kids menu or cups with lids for children we were a little disappointed in the mini taco appetizer that was 7 for 10 soggy tortilla chips wrapped around beef that was microwaved however the pizza was absolutely fabulous and we would definitely come back to order the pizza if fosters was more child friendly i would have given a better rating|1
so basically i brought my car in to have the alarm removed its a 97 have a windshield replaced and get the rear hatchback working i gave them a limit and they decided to repair the alarm instead of fix it i left with a new alarm which has already failed and spent another 700 elsewhere to to remove the alarm fix the trunk and replace the windshield which was originally asked for anyway so in short what should have been 700800 ended up costing me 2500 in the end unfortunately my wifes car had the same experience electrical problem was band aided by replacing a new battery with a newer battery for 300 120 at etc a few weeks later the same problem arose which i guess it wasnt the battery and was fixed for 400 and now a two months later same thing all over again buy a new car there if u want but id stay out of the service center|0
went there today to get some lunch meat the employee there was extremely rude to me she got the first item i asked for then went to the register i wanted something else and the look she gave me was scary so i asked if there was a problem and she said real snotty we close at 5 the door was open and the open sign was on but apparently it was closed and i was preventing her from going home to celebrate columbus day so i will not be going there anymore there are a lot of other places who will take my money|0
not impressed took a chance off other yelp reviews made appointments for my mom and i they did not have anyone for my mom done about 20 minutes apart defeats the purpose of going together guy nipped my skin with clippers old rickety chairs radio blaring with so many commercials not relaxing super short massage wont be back|0
the food was terrible it was bland prepared in a hurry and nothing that i couldnt have done myself i had visited before and had a great experience which polarized this bad one i had also invited friends and had sung the restaurants praises which enticed them to come along and try it was just bad all around very disappointing i feel like they are too concerned with the ambiance and not the quality fo the food|0
food was awful i wouldnt feed that lasagna to my dog not to mention the fact that they seemed really put out that we didnt have a reservation though the place was completely empty really bad experience|0
if you want a big church like this you can experience it on to it used to be small and welcoming now it is too much like evangelical to for me try munni or another united for a local small medium church|0

i went there this past saturday night 111613 and ordered the flounder it was supposed to come with a side salad and two sides i can not eat salad so ordered the soup turns out they dont have soup i decided to substitute the salad with something else on the menu like the mixed vegetables turns out they dont have mixed vegetables which is on the menu so i asked for the rice which is also on the menu and the waitress said they dont have rice either so instead of the rice i ordered a baked potato thats all she brought broiled flounder which was very good and a baked potato which was the usual baked potato she did not ask me if i wanted a different appetizer to substitute for the lack of a salad or another side since they didnt have the rice on the menu she didnt even ask me if i wanted tarter sauce or cocktail sauce so i ate it straight up it was still good my friend ordered the salad and shrimp scampi very small portion and pasta as the side we got garlic bread which was too thick and not enough butter well im sure it was margarine or some sort of oil i have been to this restaurant many times in the 34 years i have lived i belmont even when it was a chinese restaurant it used to have the best pizza in town but frankly simonetti i is far better and i dont expect to go back to dime trios my friend liked it but he loves everything so he is no quality assurance judge i would recommend demetrios for pizza only and take out not dine in if you want good fish in belmont go to catfish cove or amber jacks or captain is all of which are very good|0
vicky i nail studio is wonderful she has done a great job fixing it up and you always are greeted when you come in they provide excellent service|1
i am no expert on dentists as i had been going to one my whole life and recently switched to this one for convince sake the staff were pleasant from the receptionist to the hygienist i didnt see the dentist and i am not sure if it is normal for a cleaning and examine to be separate from one another but aside from that no complaints|1
it is with great sadness that after yr going to this salon i must now say that im really disappointed i have a horrible bacteria on my foot the tools were not clean i called to tell them and i was brushed off like its not possible it couldve come from them my manicure and pedicure were both done in a rush because they were busy that day my manicure was chipping less than a day later my toe were the cuticle was cut began to swell and puss i was out of town and could not return to show them i called to ask for my money back and told them i would send some pictures and bring the diagnosis from a doctor i was told no ive referred a lot of people to them looks like i will need to spread the word dont go to his nail salon|0

went over to back stage tonight for some food we had some pasta which proved to be worth the modest price the wife says that the meatballs were okay but a little lacking i had the sicilian chicken tortellini it was fantastic i really like it that they have mix and match options for their pasta dishes good beer selection and good music really low key kinda place nice place to check out if the other bars in the area are really not your scene|1
we came here with a group on the vibe was very chill and seems like an ok place to hang out however the food wasnt good the fries were the best part if you stick to fries and drinks you will be fine but the group on isnt worth it nor is paying full price for the other dishes|0
soooo oo rude i ordered a photo print on the app got my order confirmation email and the email stating that the order was ready i drive all the way down there to pick it up not there the sales person would not even offer any kind of help in fact when i told her i had an email confirmation saying the photo was ready and here at the location her response was i dont know what to tell you its not here i was shocked that is the rudest customer service i have ever encountered now a photo that was supposed to be a gift is not there and i am left without a gift and apparently i need to make another arrangements why would i try to order it again since the first time went so well i can understand that stuff happens and perhaps there was a mistake but she did not offer any kind of help or solution she should be fired|0

savoury cream tea is not the love at first taste kind of food but im completely hooked on them now it is suggested that you should drink it without a straw to tast the salt cream but i think that layer on top is too strong to enjoy if your e new to it i always stu i the cream right into the tea and that makes it very enjoyable for me there are 2 other tea shops right beside but i always end up going to this one ive tried their savory teas taro milk tea and waffles and they were all good|1
called and ordered a pizza at up and it still isnt here when i called after an hour the guy said that the pizza would be there in 10 mins and went on to explain to me how short staffed he was and how its the busiest tuesday hes ever had he said hes short two employees and only has one driver i said okay its now 845pm and i still dont have my food i called back and he said oh yes i would be mad too and that he couldnt offer me an incentive for the delay the pizza finally came at 850pm and driver is not getting a tip sorry wont be ordering from here again|0

worst pedicure and brow wax ever i have been going to is nails for years however after my experience two days ago i will not be returning i dont typically request any one person for a pedicure and so got an older lady who i believe may be fairly new during the pedi she cut one toe until it bled and scraped another the exfoliating and leg massage was almost nonexistent however it wasnt until i got home and had a close look at my toenails that i discovered there was polish on the skin in many many places the nails had not been properly prepared and my heels were still as rough as they were when i went in with respect to the brow wax the paper on the bed table was dirty and i refused to sit on it she ripped off the dirty part and made my lay on the little bit of paper that was left instead of replacing it she asked if i wanted the brow hair length trimmed with scissors and as i said no she clipped one side off anyway again once i got home i could tell how uneven my brows were i would not recommend and will not be returning to is nails|0
walked in to eurozone late in the evening on easter sunday with a car battery we thought was dead they tested the battery confirms it was dead made reasonable recommendations for a new battery and helped explained how to install it overall they were very helpful and we were happy the were available on easter sunday|1
unfortunately this place looks like a dungeon once you get through the elevators if you want your loved ones to actually be cared for by people with compassion do not come to this place instead of doing their jobs during the day when patients etc are awake they come in in the middle of the night instead and if you are sharing a room with someone else that disrupts the other person i always had to go hunting down a nurse or someone to help and the actual pa assistant and i got into a verbal confrontation and he was less than professional the rooms are dirty the bathrooms are disgusting and the furniture in the rooms have put together and falling apart thank god shes no longer at this place|0
i recently came in for an evaluation with them and i have to say they were the nicest people i have ever met do reardon is a peach as well they answered all my questions and concerns i have looked around for other orthodontist and i didnt feel as comfortable as i did here some things came up and i was out of town but i am definitely coming to them i am telling you as soon as you walk in and start interacting with them they make you feel really comfortable|1

the worst service ever i came here for a pedicure 1 two minutes into the pedicure she asked me if she could go and wax another customers armpits first of all too much information secondly this customer came in after me and never said she was in a hurry although she is a repeat customer so i suspect that she just wanted to make her happy 2 she was sloppily cutting my cuticles and then cut my skin 3 i was wearing birkenstocks and she looked over at my sandals and asked me how long ive had them she said that i must have had them for a long time because of the look of the inner sole for the record ive had them for one year and thats how birds are supposed to look 4 i was rapidly shipped out of the chair when she was done she asked me to pay right away and walked over to the register i didnt want to ruin the polish so i told her i would pay once it finished drying im never coming here again i could have done a better job myself and i also dont appreciate being treated like cattle|0

i have been shopping at this place for a couple years now because they have great prices on organics even though they arent the freshest its fine when you are going to use them immediately just the other day i discovered that they are re bagging regular bananas and selling them as organic i cant be 100 certain but you can check for yourself they might not do this every day but im pretty sure they did it yesterday all i can say is i will not give my money to a business that is trying to deceive their customers you be the judge and check the packaging and labelling yourself ie is the original sticker on the produce or is it bagged in the original bag i would rather pay more money for fresher produce to honest business owners like ko produce a few blocks down the street and no i am not affiliated with them in any way i am just angry about dishonesty and hope that others are not fooled|0

annie at organic tans and teeth whitening was excellent when i got there i didnt have to wait and she was ready to start whitening my teeth she was super nice and i could tell she had done this many times as she made sure i had everything i needed she was really easy to talk to and the salon was new clean and didnt have an awkward vibe salon goers im sure youve been to one that did i called and she made time so that i could come in the next day i love my new smile and have to admit ive admired them a few times in the mirror i quit smoking a few months ago and havent missed a morning coffee in i dont know how long i finished up my session and my teeth were as white as possible before going into veneers i was also a little jealous because the person before me had gotten a spray tan and it smelled amazing most spray tans i have gotten have a weird y smell that i cant stand i have always had really sensitive teeth but the whitening didnt hurt and they were only a little sensitive for a few hours afterwards i can not definitely recommend this teeth treatment to all my friends with sensitive teeth i have tried crest strips before and was near tears in pain she also sent me home with a whitening pen to up keep my pearly whites i am loving my white teeth i will never go anywhere else to whiten my teeth she also had the best deal around for the same treatment that some people over pay for thank you annie|1
we went to the slush bar to get our slushy cups while in vegas the bartender was really friendly and she told us to go down to old vegas and to make sure we saw the fountain show in front of the fellatio which we later did the smallest cup was 10 bucks but was by no means small so my friend and i got that i got the banana foster and the price for the drink plus the cup was the 10 which is awesome for vegas because drinks are expensive there and like i said it came with the cup compared to some of the other places it is very reasonably priced here and i would definitely go back the banana foster frozen drink was yummy and my friends strawberry daiquiri was yum too thumbs up slush bar|1

do not rent from these people after recently moving to vegas from berkeley ca because of the much cheaper rents i applied 824 in person and talked to a young lady named kimberly i had talked to her a couple of times over the phone in previous weeks waiting for my social security which was delayed due to a computer glitch she explained what i thought were all the details including a credit check i dutifully made an info sheet about me stating at the top which stated i never had a credit card and had not used a bank in 40 years i also relayed this info in the interview i have a perfect payment record with only 2 landlords in berkeley for 26 years after applying and paying a 45 application fee and a 100 hold fee which would be applied to my first months rent she assigned me a unit and gave me a sheet stating my move in costs after everything was 485 i left feeling a found a great place to live even though the studio i was about to rent wasnt finished yet as they were renovating an older complex when i got home i realized i had to contact the cable and electric companies i called them again to get an exact address for the utilities and a post office address change i got the answering machine and left a message this went on for 6 days as i left 2 messages with a receptionist and several machine messages i even got a hold of the emergency repair people and asked them to contact the office still nothing i was supposed to move in on 94 today 830 i took the bus again from centennial hills and walked into the office at around 10 the cubicles containing the rental agents were occupied by other people i inquired about kimberly and as was told she was no longer there an office manager named marcella asked my name and said she would help me as this happened another woman comes out of an office with a sign stating that they were all in a meeting and locked the front door another woman is allowed in and starts complaining her air conditioning hadnt been fixed in weeks and told marcella who began writing it all down she said every time someone came to look at it they said the air is blowing she said that isnt the problem it leaks this makes me wonder then marcella asks the woman who put the sign on the door to help me she comes out with my file and says ive been conditionally approved i said what do mean conditional i also told her about all the phone calls and message and she goes wow after sitting down at the desk with a computer she asked if kimberly had given me the move in costs i said yes and inquired about the exact address which is why i was there in the first place she then tells me my move in cost for the 450 studio would be 735 because i didnt have any credit they were charging me a 250 charge for a year until i proved i could pay even though they verified i was on social security and had a part time job at this point i became i rate and asked what about my spotless payment record in berkeley for 26 years she didnt look at me and at this point marcella came over and both tried apologize and said it was policy at this point i said forget the whole thing if i had known about the extra 250 for the no credit after telling kimberly that i wouldnt have taken it and paid the 145 which of course was non refundable i said forget the whole left and called siegel suites i move in wednesday with no hidden fees or nonsense mi casita also neglected to tell me nevada electric requires a 250 deposit too these people are unprofessional and incompetent at best|0

just finished up master and guest bath and can not recommend this company to anyone the only reason it gets 2 stars is the workmanship of the subs came out very nice we started this project 11092015 and now just waiting on a small repair this is after the sales person jacque sold it as a slow time of the year and might get done by end of year shame on me for ever thinking that was possible ran into one problem after another including client provided items with no specs so we bought items that were not correct would have been helpful to have specs on those items there so called included decorator waste of time unless you want to pay ex the price of items you can find on your own most disappointed at my decision to use these people one last thing if you try calling to speak to the owner you will not get a call back or acknowledgement|0

very unimpressed with the professionalism standards at this clinic had requested my medical history to be transferred from another clinic as i had just moved to calgary did their paperwork as required two weeks later they hadnt even started it they claimed i never filled in the paperwork at first then after a quick look through my notes there was the forms i filled in also the doctor i saw was very rude and seemed like he didnt like his chosen profession essentially fobbed me off the first appointment and told me he wasnt doing anything until he had my medical history why i proceeded with the medical note transfer i dont know this should have been a warning sign second time the doctor in question said you should have gone to the hospital for it and i wont help you with this same problem he said hed only check last time if i had notes and made me wait two weeks for nothing to happen then just walks out the room without so much as a goodbye or thanks i had to go to the front desk to find out if my appointment was over or not is this the quality of care the owners of this company expect from their doctors if so im certainly glad i found a much nicer clinic nearby to coin a horrible pun avoid like the plague|0

i did a lot of research before getting my braids and by looking at the pictures on tania i website decided to go to her the first time was a good experience my hair was absolutely beautiful i sensed an attitude from her and she told me 250 and charged me 300 i received so many compliments on my braids second time a year later my appointment was at 230 and they didnt start my hair until almost 6 i was severely i off but i needed my hair done then when they were ready i was rushed to hurry up and get in the chair after i sat there for 3 hours i had ordered food and was trying to pack it up and she was snapping her fingers at me needless to say i was done in 3 hours because three pal braided at once no apologies for the wait tho i referred a friend she loved her braids and went to tania i for almost a year straight every two months faithful and spent 250 another person did them once and she was very unhappy she asked to have them redone tania agreed and said come back in a few weeks ill fix them when she did go back was asked for 200 dollars they got into a huge argument and my friend left and never went back i was there two months ago and cant recall anything bad happening 2 weeks ago i went for a touch up the lady had me in a very uncomfortable position as did tania the time before that to where my neck was hurting so badly you would think that they would make sure customer is comfortable but no every time i moved or showed signs of pain they both huffed and puffed like it was my fault no you find a way to braid my hair so that my neck isnt twisted she told me 50 i get there and she says 60 then 90 they spoke in there language the whole time where loud didnt speak to me at all you pay all that money and they use 1 dollar blue magic grease on your hair shes extremely rude and money hungry and yes its not clean the bathroom is terrible dish soap as hand soap but i will say that as far as quality hands down the best braiding salon stand firm dont let them bully you say how you feel and let them know that you will not tolerate rudeness ink if ill be back oh and the credit card machine isnt broke they just want cash|0

cleaner was just ok wasnt a deep cleaning it may have been different if i stayed on the property while she cleaned but i couldnt also she was scheduled to go to another job during my hour cleaning time frame and tried to leave after only 25 hours i was still charged for 4 hours i had to bring it to the companys attention before i could get a prorated refund also beware that they charge sales tax which is not right as nevada does not charge sales tax on service unless it results in you purchasing a tangible item i had to verify it twice with nevada department of taxation because the owner was adamant that he is required to do so he did end up refunding the sales tax the special i received was not a bad deal but i guess i got what i paid for in the end i wasted a whole lot of time and gained a few more gray hair|0

please ban cell phones for hostesses and waitresses this review is purely based on that statement several that i could see were on their phones at one time or another while people waited to be seated waited to place an order or waited for food to be delivered four tables that i could see were empty with dishes and glasses on the tables long after people left did i mention cell phones do your job please and texting isnt it the part that bugs me is we enjoy coming here as wings are always good and other food is as well service issues need to be addressed big time|0
did these guys change management recently i stopped in for a caffeine refuel after a hike in the mountains and will definitely not be coming back the once authentically relaxing vibe has become rather generic and the americano quality was memorable i intended to just come in and out but the gal working didnt notice me at the counter for a minute or two i thought she was just finishing something up before serving but then i realized she wasnt even paying attention to the counter cash register yikes while waiting i eyed some sad looking pastries both shiny and old and reminisced about better times at the be an bring this place back to what it used to be|0
i just want to start out by saying ra sheen is the best she is also very professional and listens she is extremely patient and will go above and beyond to make it right i went to her years ago and lost her contact info imagine my elated surprise when i was doing a search and found her extension studio was now closer to my house and it was her i called her and scheduled an appointment and am so happy i found her as i was telling her i could write a book on all of my hair experiences i am very picky and i have tried wets tapes individual fusion and never been happy the other sew in method that people do can sometimes be bulky and easily detected you are constantly afraid if the wind blows a certain way people will see it not with ra sheen she has perfected her method and is a true artist she also had her colorist custom color my hair to match my blonde and the different tones in my hair i am so happy i found ra sheen again and i would highly recommend her to anyone wanting a natural look thank you|1

i moved here in may of 2017 because i had a dog and it seemed like a nice place to live i even had a pool across from my apartment i was told during my tour that it was fully operational however it was drained the day after i moved in and was not open until 1 week before it was closed up after labor day i had problems from day one my intercom didnt work and i was told it wasnt their problem because it was contracted through an outside company it was never fixed my air conditioner never worked and even backed up and flooded my living room they dried the carpet with an industrial fan then threw the carpet back into the corner but left the matting balled up underneath in the middle of the living room the place reeked of freon and musty carpet i had headaches all the time i made numerous requests to either fix or replace it they refused i had over 10 things go wrong that i needed maintenance to fix then my last electric bill was double the highest amount ive ever paid 17300 i live alone and travel three nights a week my fuses kept blowing even when i wasnt home i showed them the bill and asked for the manager to call me and have maintenance come check out the wiring i never heard a word from them but they did tape a note to my door that said i needed to resign a new contract which was 2500 more and if i didnt they would change my lease to month to month and charge me 1000 a month rent thats extortion it is illegal for either party to change the contract halfway through the lease i packed up and moved out the next day i will not be bullied by anyone the actual apartment was very nice looking but nobody picks up their dog poop and its everywhere i would never recommend this place because of the lack of integrity of the staff be very careful if you rent from them leslie quattrocchi|0

i was just there tonight for the comedy show we had a group of 10 and we all got dinners appetizers and drinks they charged us for too many drinks mixed up our orders took way too long to bring the food and check and return the check the food all tasted bad i personally had the chicken caesar salad hard to screw up right for one thing the tiny burnt chicken i got cost 4 extra the dressing tasted terrible but at least it covered the taste of the bad lettuce the comedy act was ok the opener was terrible but the main act had us laughing semi consistently i will never go back not even if every bit if this expensive terrible night was free|0
great idea good price if you book in advance online unfortunately the bus we were on broke down and we were stranded waiting to be picked up in other buses with whatever room they had took extra 15 hours to make it back to start if you have a family be prepared that not everyone may be able to sit on the same level great idea but too oversold to be executed when we visited|0

terrible experience do not shop there you will get over charged be treated terrible by snobby sales people and forced to open a credit card dear gap let me tell you of the worst experience we had at your store and why we will never come back our experience is one of discrimination and preferential treatment horrible customer service my husband was attracted by 40 off promo and spend half an hour picking out jeans and shirts as he got to the register he got a snobby remark he does not qualify because he does not have a gap card now the sales person should of given him 30 off but instead they asked him to pay full retail as you would expect my husband was unhappy and left your store in south park mall charlotte he walked away from 200 purchase because he felt deceived and discriminated note we do not open credit cards with retailers that is bad way to manage financials i was furious my husband does not shop often and now that he finally did he had such a bad treatment so i contacted your customer service and they did nothing they offered 20 credit and no sale so retail once again with 20 totaling to just 10 the customer service promised the items are on sale once again at 40 and without card requirements so gets better now my husband goes back stands in line observes a lady being offered 40 off and then additional 15 off his turn comes up no sale and once again not a card holder so no sale they did not even take coupons that are active online and the sales person was snobby beyond believe she did not care to spend another minute with my husband to accommodate or find a solution sure thing he left the purchase in the store and swore that he will never ever go back to gap or even look at gap it is outrageous selective and what is even worse your quality is really not good anyways a good ending to the story my husband went to guess got great service 50 off sale bought his jeans and shirt and is happy now he will always shop there from now on bad ending for you with this experience i will no longer shop at the banana republic or any of your other stores there is enough competition for customers to say no to such forced sales pitch for credit cards and discrimination|0
the soup and roll were really good i ordered spicy thai fired rice on lunch with level 5 spice and it wasnt that good most of my colleagues ordered curry fried rice and pineapple fired rice so i think those must be the popular dishes the place is definitely a good option for the price|1

i bought some black jeans recently here and they were 4000 i needed them for a particular job and i was in a rush when i put them on later i realized that they had a very strong petroleum burnt rubber smell after 5 washes which included soaking them in vinegar beforehand they still have such a strong repulsive smell i also noticed afterwards no surprise that these pants are made in china winners is gouging people by marking up the prices astronomically for cheap china garbage clothing do used in un washable chemicals i wonder about the long term respiratory effects these products will have on people if i wanted to go get chemical do used clothing from china i can just as well go to china town and pay probably 1000 for the same garbage product the chemicals are nauseating i have done some research online and discovered that non water soluble formaldehyde i have become a common chemical treatment applied to some 100 cotton items wrinkle free clothing to keep the clothing stiff and it is also used with dyes i think that winners should i evaluate the products they are selling and take into consideration the health and satisfaction of their customers no one wants to walk around the city or be around people smelling so repulsive because the stench will never wash out of these clothes also no body wants to deal with respiratory problems they were not expecting i can see a lawsuit in the future|0

today we went on the made in canada food tour with our guide leo we wanted an overview of canadian foods in a walking tour in downtown toronto and this experience exceeded our expectations we go on food tours in every city we can and this one was truly one of the best leo was prompt friendly professional and so knowledgeable he really knew his stuff he was able to answer all of our questions and gave us a thorough tour of kensington market which was exactly what we wanted each food item along the tour was better than the next and since we happen to be the only ones who booked the tour today we had a private tour with leo which also meant more food for all we came away stuffed would wholeheartedly recommend this tour company thank you leo|1
theyre great for south indian dishes and serve it within the food court itself the place itself is very limited and is quite small as it shares space with another 2 food stalls which is falafel express and the other chinese food for the amount of food you get the price is not too bad just one thing id say is to be careful with the curries and foods as i found a hair in mine and i was disgusted by it probably will never return to this place|0
butterfly is not worth it anymore i spent time and money to create a collage photo frame project then i paid over 50 for an order to arrive expedited to be told it wasnt the right level of service really 50 and they cant get it to me expedited went to walgreens photos created a photo collage in minutes and going to have it same day spent a fraction of the money too butterfly charges too much and when you get discounts it goes right back into shipping and handling|0

so as i stated on my previous review the rich tree location at the promenade shopping centre has been closed down yes i told you it was going to happen it did i am sure my post had nothing to do with the fact it did happen there are other locations and yes they are for sure better i havent tried them but they are busy and people look happy and the atmosphere is nice when you dont have customer service poorly managed team and everything looks bad you arent going to last here is an excellent example|0

came in with the wife thinking this was a family restaurant wrong they had half naked girls belly dancing on the big screen the whole time we were there also if you dont smoke do not bother coming here as you will choke on everyone elses second hand smoke we ordered the mixed platter the rice was excellent but everything else was subpar at best the protein portions were tiny and you could tell they were not the best quality the garlic sauce is so small it is not sufficient for the whole meal you will ask for more salad tasted like someone sprayed lemon on vegetables and served it as a salad it might be a decent place to hang out if your with a group of male buddies as it was mostly men drinking smoking and watching the nudie show on to but you might want to take your family somewhere a little more pig to save yourself the embarrassment|0
i love this place for several reasons first its easily accessible right off with do metro play behind the barnes noble the owner siri will most likely greet you at the door with a warm smile and an unassuming non pretentious nature the restaurant is very clean nicely decorated and well lit i like being able to actually see my food on to the food the menu is diverse with fresh appetizers salads soups curries fish plates the opening catfish is a house specialty specialty plates and fried rice dishes the first time i got a steaming plate of drunken noodles it was wonderfully prepared and i could tell the ingredients were all very very fresh in their heat scale of 15 stars i take an 8 which is perfect for experienced thai food eaters then again i take my food really hot normally tonight i had the crispy noodles in a garlicky beef sauce with fresh veg and my wife had the opening duck curry do not miss the duck curry it was spicy level 8 while maintaining its flavor and freshness the duck was big chunks of biq bird not diced little pieces like ive had at other places i took the noodles without any extra heat and im glad i did crunchy delicate flavorful its a great dish for a hesitant thai food eater in summary please go support this friendly little gem of a neighborhood place because i count on siri to keep me fed when the wife is out of town also wifey and i are both participating in her spicy curry eating contest tomorrow heat level 11 so come cheer us on|1

i honestly thought i could be one of the scarce two star reviews but i was wrong came here an hour before closing 11pm and the door was locked the owner reluctantly came over and asked us what we wanted after explicitly stating we wanted biq pork white rice we were charged for biq pork and pork fried rice 4 more despite rejecting the claim the owner continued to insist we wanted pork fried rice so we got it the biq pork was drier than the desert never in my life have i had a full chinese dish i couldnt eat but this was repulsive similarly the pork in the pork fried rice was awful their hot sauce was good if you have any choice even if your e drunk please do not eat here|0
if i could give this place a 5 i would i have a double knee and lower back chronic injury that requires medical attention on a regular basis i have been there several times trying to make an appointment and have been refused treatment i was told i need to have my medical records sent there before i see a doctor i had the records sent and even brought other records i had and then they stated i cant be seen until a doctor reviews them i have called numerous times still no appointment they refuse to give me an appointment for absolutely no reason office is very rude as well|0
its not the fanciest place you ever go to but its not supposed to be its a nice laid back bar with good pizza and wings|1
not worth it we were gifted a group on for this place which should already tell you the kind of dire straits its in and encountered issues from the get go we were told that we had to purchase four entrees for our 40 cash voucher to be valid there were two of us nothing in the fine print of the group on voucher indicated that as a condition upon further inspection we found reviews from group on users who had complained of the same hassle from the restaurant and management after negotiating with the less than accommodating manager who decided to make our 40 voucher only apply to 20 our food came it was not worth the trouble to say the least fries were not hand cut as indicated in some of these reviews the burger was dry and limp and my partner found three hairs in his sandwich save your time save your money|0

preface i have had eyelash extensions in the past and am well versed on care and maintenance of lash extensions its only been a week and these extensions are falling out everywhere my previous extensions not with this business always lasted almost 3 weeks i do not know if it is a different adhesive or they were placed incorrectly but i have never had my extensions shed this much in the past i brush them gently in the morning and use care with them in the shower this is a pricey service and while i know they need to be filled on a regular basis thinning out in less than a week is unacceptable|0

first they tried to rip me off for an extra 100 tank rental because i didnt use enough propane for the year then they helped me by putting in 2 full smaller 25 gallon cycling ders that i own instead of rent removing the 40 full 150 gallon tank on 92315 122815 i refill one almost empty propane cycling der seems a little soon for one old lady with only a propane hot water heater and stove a 25 gallon cylinder supposedly is full at 236 gallons but az propane says 25 so ok but they ticket me for 436 gallons i call and get blowed off with oh he must of topped off the other tank so he put 25 gallons in the 25 gallon tank doubtful since the regulator hadnt switched over to the full tank and added 182 gallons to the full tank these people are preying on seniors at the very least and may be on all their customers now i find out the 25 gallon cylinders cant be filled by other companies so i understand now their eagerness to help me with these 25 gallon cycling ders i wont even get into the 357 a gallon price higher than any other propane prices in the buckeye area im stuck with them but your e not dont use this service|0
i have been a customer of port of subs for at least 20 years this location has however been consistently horrible honestly go to the 215 flamingo location as their service is top notch tonight i walked in and it was busy they had 3 employees working with no sense of urgency i finally get to the line about to order after 10 minutes of waiting i place my order and do all my toppings one of the employees disappears so now there are only two working instead of the employee who finished making my sandwich ring me up she assists the guy behind me as well mind you he walked in just as i was placing my order so he had experienced no wait and now continued to wait until he made all his decisions then she cuts up my order and wraps and i think ok she will ring me up now nope continues with the guy behind me again it should not take 20 minutes in port of subs at 710pm and needless to say there should be a sense of urgency to move through your line i get home 5 minutes later and my sandwich is saturated in oil awesome|0
i have just recently discovered this lovely place and ive already been there twice and planning my third trip i have stopped in for coffee and a delicious pastry before work and taken a date there for board games and beer in the evening this place is adorable fun and the staff are super nice|1

such a great place to get a variety of food at an affordable price its a great atmosphere especially in the summer theres so much great ethnic food i would recommend caracas empanadas bank o and the korean taco food stand their used to be a healthy mexican food truck but havent seen it recently however if its around thru have great tamales|1
i love german food and as far as the food went at bavarian point they had some good eats the only reason im giving the restaurant two stars instead of one is the food their rinds roulade was very good and the red cabbage and spaetzle were excellent but the quality of the food was undercut by the poor service it was bad enough that i wouldnt return and certainly wouldnt recommend it to anyone else as others have noted there was no one to greet or seat us not even a sign saying seat yourself our waitress took a long time to make it to our table to take our drink orders and when she did she was complaining about something and looked put out in general when my wife ordered a beer the waitress told her that it would be more expensive because it wasnt available on tap now that could be useful information but the manner in which she told my wife was defiant rather than helpful believe me we gave her no reason to be so sour it was clear that this particular waitress was clearly unhappy whether with her job or life its hard to say its too bad really because the food was good but why would anyone want to eat at a restaurant whose workers are either nowhere to be found or miserable not me|0
i went to this school in the is and now my kids go there our family are huge fans of mars temple and our teachers have been awesome best christian school in pox|1

jessica did a great job with the massage i could have sworn she had 4 hands she was very courteous and personable very attentive to my needs and gave the full hour rather than being like some of the big chain places that set a timer for 50 minutes go through the same routine and kick you out while the space isnt too large it is very cozy and welcoming and very clean the massage was inexpensive and worth more than i paid i would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a solid massage|1
i liked adam hes a real charming guy and his shop is really cool but he gave me a crappy haircut and he did the same thing to my friend i told him i wanted it trimmed all around not too short on the back and not too long on top well he gave me a classic hipster haircut super short on the back and super long on top exactly what i didnt want|0

exceptional service i came here 15 minutes before closing to pick up a jacket and fleece for a hiking trip the sales rep that helped me was incredibly helpful he asked questions about my trip to better understand my needs and offered a number of suggestions he was also very knowledgable about each item i didnt feel rushed even though the store was then closed i also ended up ordering a few items online through the store as they didnt have my size shipping is waived in store with a life time warranty on their products and incredible service in their stores i couldnt be more pleased|1
i have been going to do bil on for close to two decades this alone should speak volumes of my confidence in his ability do bil on and his staff are extremely detailed and take their time with you during a visit you will never feel rushed through an appointment i have had some major issues with my vision detached retina in both eyes as well as cataracts do bil on directed me to specialists in the region who not only repaired my eyes but worked with do bil on to make sure that my ongoing vision is better than 2020 do bil on also has corrected vision so he understands how frustrating things can get when your vision isnt how you think it should be its always nice to have a doctor who has experienced what you are experiencing first hand at times do bil on can be conservative in his treatment or recommendation but that is simply because of the importance that he places on your health and eyesight i trust do bil on and his staff without reservation and routinely recommend him to my friends god willing i will still be seeing do bil on twenty years from now|1
my husband and i wanted to spend a couple of nights in montreal for his birthday so i did my homework and this hotel got a lot of positive reviews we were not disappointed on choosing submerge du carre it louis i booked us a room with a balcony in fact our room number 203 had two doors that opened to the balcony one off of the bedroom suite the other off of the kitchenette it felt like we had a deluxe mini apartment the bed was big comfy and with a perfect down comforter the rooms thermostat was outside of our room in the hall but once we found it we used it to make our room the right temperature for us there was a big flat screen to the remote control was hard to decipher may be a note explaining how to use it would be helpful to future guests the staff was just great so friendly and warm front desk receptionist oh any a was a stand out i felt like she was a friend the complimentary continental breakfast was fresh and tasty the coffee was very good the hotel is a block from the metro and within walking distance we walked to all of the heart of montreal our only complaint was that the shower was really weak and that the toiletries dispensers didnt work well a small complaint for what was otherwise an outstanding experience highly recommended|1

this store has a unique coffee shop vibe good coffee and decent food im a fan of this place primarily because i like the look and feel its a two story venue with raw unfinished wood construction and vibrant primary colored decor the tables are rather small but reasonable given that this place attracts a lot of people from state it the upstairs portion is better for a slightly quieter area to work and study the coffee is tasty both from the store and via take home coffee beans keep in mind its cheaper to get the coffee in a mug than in a paper cup the espresso shake won me over all 5 or so times that ive ordered it the white chocolate mocha is alright i prefer the starbucks take on the drink the 7 layer bar is more gimmicky than tasty its got chocolate chips peanuts and 5 other random nuggets the sandwiches and wraps are good for a quick bite to eat|1
told i this program is not designed for your to succeed best body is a deceitful and dishonest company they advertise it as free when in fact you must pay 400 plus tax before any sort of physical assessment and they tell you you get your money back if you meet a goal they give you the goal i was given was to lose 6 body fat which i achieved through healthy diet and exercise yet still do not get my money back at the beginning of the program i weighed in with 26 body fat and my final weigh in is 198 body fat ultimately the reason came down to the fact that i didnt follow the nutrition plan as close as she felt was necessary in addition to the many other requirements i followed the nutritional guidelines to the best of my ability the only mention of the nutrition plan in the contract is in section ad which states follow as closely as possible the nutrition plan provided and determined by i bac i did this however as i am human was not perfect and my imperfections in my diet were not because i allowed too many cheats in fact i didnt have a single cheat day it was because my ratios werent perfect day to day the app you have to use my fitness pal was flawed in that in didnt break down carbs properly and so a cup of chopped bananas was equal to a cup of white pasta i was in regular communication about this with my trainer and he assured me it would be fine side note my trainer was fantastic and none of my frustrations with the owners and this company apply to him 12 hours before my final weigh in i started my period this resulted in a 45 la weight gain overnight ladies we know this is normal as our bodies are carrying an overabundance of water weight during this time of the month i have been weighing myself and measuring myself regularly throughout the program so to ensure accuracy of the readings in class sure enough i measured 21 body fat in class for my final weigh in when the morning before i was 198 my trainer totally empathized as he saw how hard and consistent i was working throughout the program i decided to email the owner of the company daniela na has in hopes i could demonstrate my results the following week after my period was over she took several days to get back to me any communication from within the company was always horrible and took a very long time for a response and denied my request instead of focusing on the issue at hand my skewed reading due to my monthly cycle she focused on my macros being off which ultimately was the reason she decided i wasnt eligible for my refund i pointed out to her that the contract only states to follow it as closely as as possible which is exactly what i did however she continued to argue that it wasnt close enough ultimately it comes down to her discretion and they dont make a living by refunding people so they make it very difficult to actually get your money back despite your compliance with the program another very alarming part of her email was when she said it is unlikely that in a weeks time a full would have been dropped even if you were not on your period the entire program is predicated on being able to lose 6 in 6 weeks ie 1 per week this was yet another indicator that the program is not designed for me to succeed with real results and that it was unlikely that i was ever going to get my money back daniela and i spoke on the phone and she touched on this point again however her reasoning didnt reduce my concern she explained this point was in reference to my diet although in the email she stated it was in reference to my period she said my calories were too low to make this possible although i find this explanation extremely flawed as if i actually was at an unhealthy caloric deficit i wasnt then i should be able to lose even more than 1 in a week no in regards to granting my the extra week to weigh in daniela insisted it wouldnt be fair to others in previous 6 week challenges they had granted a ith week when the holidays interfered with the schedule so i did not feel it was out of the question to ask for the same leniency due to my cycle daniela insisted the challenge was different then however i still feel the precedent had been set overall in my final communication with daniela i saw many desperate attempts at explaining why they werent granting me my money back none of which actually proved i did anything to break the contract and therefore deem me ineligible for my refund she was grasping at straws there were so many red flags i ignored from the get go and as a result i lost 400 i fully support entrepreneurs in the health and fitness sphere however this is a company full of deceit false promises and downright dishonest business practices please dont make the same mistake i made do not give them your money do not give them your business|0

wells fargo foreclosed my condominium in 2010 for 36000 that i owed to them on that condo at the time of foreclosure i heard about 5300 people being fired from wells fargo for corrupting cash by creating phony accounts how much corruption was done with the housing bail out money that government gave them to keep people like me from becoming homeless did anyone else go through the same situation that i did or i was the only one also the houses that they saved how many of those transactions were fraud and how many of them were legal i know a couple of fraud cases whos rental properties were saved creating corrupt documents saying they were their primary residence what other kind of corruption they did is there any compliance agency looking into this issue at this time how are they planning to compensate the effected people we need checks and balances from wells fargo explaining exactly how and on whom the bail out money was used i received a check from wells fargo today in the amount of 15472 as a settlement of the case i mentioned above i ripped it off and threw it in the garbage i believe cashing the check means i accepted wells fargo i settlement which i dont want to do very clever though who ever was the mastermind behind it new news is that wells fargo is saying they would compensate the customers who faced damages by wells fargo well i havent heard of any customers other than me who faced damages were there any how would we know if wells fargo is not planning to compensate the same customers they already did once the cases i am aware of are the cases where the customers got over paid way over paid based on obvious lies and frauds which wells fargo was aware of through out but knowingly compensated those customers fraudulently the lies and frauds that i am aware of are customer claimed their rental properties to be their personal residence having several properties and claiming to have only one etc but due to wells fargo i poor record keeping system they got lucky and had their houses saved and got way over paid thats the investigation i am talking about that would request the authorities to do and then show the us public the result the outcome of the investigation on the to news channels for us to see the deeds of the wells fargo so next time when you send me a settlement check make sure it is not leas than 2 million after paying all the taxes|0

i will never rent from these guys in my life first we rented a 6 on 1 water jumper but i was never told that i needed to provide my own long hose at the time of renting it they never ever told me so when they arrived and set it up then they ask me for it and they said i would have to go and get one because they dont provide it second and after i bought my own hose the jumper stopped 4 times with the kids inside not sure why i called the owner and he gave me the stupidest explanation on how to fix that problem excuse me jumper man but if i am paying you 255 for a jumper i at least expect some better service than just bringing me the jumper not happy at all with them sorry but i will not be advertising your services at all|0
i love papa murph i but both times i have been to this location i have been severely disappointed the first time i walked in and it took a few minutes before the kids stopped their conversation behind the counter to actually help me today i ordered a pizza and it took 30 minutes for them to make it because only one person was staffed horrible i will be going somewhere else from now on|0

the food is old dry and has no taste whatsoever i work in the hospital i have given this place several chances and every time i come here i am incredibly disappointed with the food the butter chicken has no flavour i dont usually add salt to my meals however i had to add three packages of salt to my meal that is crazy the chicken legs looks incredibly dry due to sitting under the heat lamps all day they should not appear to have wrinkles on the skin my colleagues have bought the chicken legs for lunch and the meat was stringy not normal for chicken legs i was ordering 12 fries and 12 onion rings unfortunately they no longer sell them this way you would have to buy a side of fries and a side of onion rings therefore they have lost my business forever the owners are fortunate that they get unsuspecting and new customers each day because it is a hospital if their business were based on returning customers they would go bankrupt very quickly also look at the lineups theres lineups at subway hero burger and dru xy i the staff knows not to eat there because they know that the food is horrible|0
a lot of us dont know much when it comes to our very important vehicles that we really cant do without when your e looking for a mechanic the thing that matters possibly most of all is the integrity of the person you dont want to get jerked around you dont want to get lied to you dont want to get scammed ideally you just want to pay the person a fair transaction to get the job fixed as painless as possible jim is that guy my family and i have been going to jims for a decade and hes always been fair and communicative and reasonably priced not only that but jim has stood up for his customers in the court of law on a few occasions my mother being one of them fighting other automobile shyster who have at one point or another tried to defraud his customers if there is anything this guy hates its someone trying to be dishonest i will note however jim and pals are pretty high in demand and the waiting list can be high at times if you only have one car and cant work out some leapfrog approach with a friends automobile the wait may be too long for you go ahead and call to find out but it usually takes at least a weeks advanced notice|1

i have to spread the news about lisa i came to see her after being under a lot of stress being a full time mom ive been seeing lisa for about 6 months now each treatment was a therapy session for myself shes nurturing and emotionally available to help discuss my troubles next to doing a great job at alleviating my stomach bug problems stress etc i chose to give up my monthly massages for this and it has been instrumental in my wellbeing like the other reviewer said her office is clean and extremely comfortable i had spoken to 3 other acupuncturist in vegas before making the decision to see lisa actually it was a no brainer because she listens and her practices just makes sense i will miss her when i move but i am glad i found her definitely talk to her about essential oils as therapy treatment too an innovative take on hollis tic medicine|1

there are a few things that have influenced my rating they are listed below 1 confusion from front desk staff around how to apply payment for rooms booked through an organization credit card there was initially holds on each of our individual credit cards that took some time to work out there was additional confusion when checking out since fees were prepaid 2 twice in my room things were left by housekeeping the first day after id had cleaning done a green cleaning cloth was left on my dresser the second day a black thong underwear was left in my closet it didnt belong to me 3 lastly i had one of the most unpleasant experiences in the hotel restaurant urban farmer with the wait staff and the restaurant manager i still have yet to receive a call from the general manager which was my request the waiter was obnoxious and not patient with me around an order i was placing so much so that my table was even responding whats wrong with him he brought me part of the order that i had specifically asked him not to bring and when i complained he was dismissive when i asked to speak to the manager someone came out and after my complaint he only answered that i was being loud and aggressive i was indeed angry and frustrated and agree that i was using swear words to describe how the exchange with the waiter went down when i then pointed out that there were no black patrons in the restaurant except me and that it didnt bode well that i was being treated this way the manager pointed out that this wasnt true that his entire staff was black i was offended by the racially profiled characteristic of being loud and aggressive coupled with emphasizing all of his staff were black as if to make up for the fact that there are no black patrons in the restaurant not once did he apologize on behalf of his wait staff and my experience until i highlighted this fact the apology was not genuine after trying to speak with someone above him the food and beverage manager called the general manager and he said he would get in touch with me i have yet to receive a call my experience in cleveland has been marred by this very unpleasant exchange lack of remorse for my experience and lack of follow up by the hotel staff|0

what a great find my friend and i went in for the hour long foot massage upon arrival we were shown down a hallway of private rooms to a room with a couple of lower height massage beds subdued lighting nice and quiet soaked our feet about 10 minutes in just right temperature of warm hot water then on to the massage not only our feet was massaged they started and worked down from our heads to face ears neck and arms all on top of our clothing they do have regular oil massages too plus hot stone massages it was very nice also the air in their establishment is infused with a wonderful aroma with soft gentle music in the background after our feet and lower legs were thoroughly massaged a wet hot towel was used to clean and lightly massage our feet so good then we were given a finish up massage on our backs never knew we were going to have this much attention definitely am coming back again|1

be very careful when you purchase a puppy from this place i may have just had bad luck but a lot of things that happened to me could have been prevented had puppy boutique cared more about the animals well being rather than the money in their pockets when i purchased our new puppy 2 weeks ago we were extremely happy with the service we received during the actual purchase process vanessa was helping us and she was very sweet to us the night we brought her home we noticed our new puppy was coughing really bad we took her to the vet they told us to take her to flamingo pet clinic where i was told she was healthy after showing the videos of her coughing to the vet i was given an antibiotic but on the paper work i received everything was marked healthy even kennel cough if she had kennel cough they should have marked it on the paperwork given to me something should have been marked she was given an antibiotic i then realized our new puppy was never given her parvo shot promised by vanessa i was told by vanessa she would give our new puppy her parvo shot and later found out she never did give her the shot the day we bought her one week after i had our puppy i took her to a different vet when they called flamingo pet clinic to get her medical records they were told she wasnt a patient even though the receptionist was telling flamingo pet clinic she was holding a prescription from their clinic after the first set of antibiotics i took our puppy back to flamingo pet clinic and was given two new prescriptions to help kick the end of the kennel cough 2 days later i had to pay 300 to another vet because she got much worse shes not playing or eating like she used to im still waiting for the radiologist results but the doctor was able to see major inflammation in her lungs and possibly an enlarged heart yesterday was exactly 2 weeks that we have had our puppy and she is just getting worse our puppy is crate trained and sleeps all night she is so miserable and sick she was up all night coughing wheezing hard and hacking she is just falling asleep at 630am and i havent slept at all wish puppy boutique would be more responsible and would have let me know she was sick when i bought her the vet from flamingo pet clinic was there when i was purchasing her he knew she was sick because she sounded really bad when we got home vanessa even slipped up the friday after i purchased her and mentioned she knew the puppy was sick its so sad when you actually want to buy a puppy to love and enjoy there are people out there like puppy boutique that will sell you a sick dog she is truly suffering and it breaks my heart im saving all my records from all my doctors and will be going to the vet board and anywhere else i have to go because this is not fair to my puppy myself or my family|0
everything about this place is ofputting it seems like a cafe but the space is so huge and underutilized that it loses any sense of home y ness there are way too many people working i believe i counted as many employees as patrons their display windows are poorly laid out the actual products in them are sparse and not very appetizing but the worst part is the actual food after panzer rouge packed up and left apparently without paying any of their bills ive been left with a weekly hankering for the hot sandwiches that they had not wanting to venture down to the black camel which is fantastic bow i decided to give this audacious space a chance as id seen that their board outside said they have hot sandwiches i got attended to very quickly and was pointed to the very back of the very long display windows when asked for hot sandwiches there were two types of sandwiches with no signs to let anyone know what they are let me say here that these are not sandwiches they are just single slabs of day old bread with ingredients splattered on top these are also not hot well they may have been at some point but certainly not when theyre being sold the girl helping me guessed which one was which one was a shrimp saffron affair and the other was some kind of chicken concoction another lady rang them up 29 and change and asked the girl serving me if the salads are coming to which the girl replies no the cashier asks if i dont want the salads only at this point does the girl bother to let me know there is a salad with these so called sandwiches already being too deep into this i decide to get my 30 worth by agreeing to the salads that i was entitled to so i heated them up and started eating them one bite into the shrimp saffron sandwich and i almost vomited no sign of saffron but i could taste a lot of different flavors all competing with each other to mask the disgusting taste of rotten shrimp but failing miserably the chicken one tasted like the kind of terrible prepared frozen dinner lean cuisine garbage people buy in the frozen aisle and peel half way and nuke rubbery chicken waaay too much cream and not really very much else the salad was good but really how can you mess a salad up so after spending 30 on two pieces of stale bread topped with awful tasting subpar ingredients i ended up having to make food anyways both sandwiches went into the refuse one bite in pathetic if your e going to boldly announce that your e selling hot sandwiches do it right i dont know how the actual bakery is but i will not find out as i am disgusted with this place told i ugly space incompetent service terrible sandwiches extremely and unjustifiably overpriced|0

march ith 2018 believe what other yelp reviewers are saying about the customer service in this store i have been to this store twice and both times i walked out feeling bad the sales lady is just rude and should not be in the retail customer facing role unless she gets some training previous experience was with the guy who wont even care to make an eye contact its a pretty small store so there is literally no way someone can miss another person in the store why even go in to the store to experience passive contempt|0
i wish i could give zero star i had a very bad experience here at tutor time at bell and with it the staff is very bad as well as the director i sent my 15 month old daughter for the half day on very first day itself the teachers were not looking at her and not talking to her my daughter was continuously crying and nobody offered her toys or even water and nobody came to sooth her on first day crying or upsetting is very normal and usual behavior but what efforts the teachers put makes a difference i feel babies need little pamper in initial days so that they feel secure i saw they did not put any efforts they behaved like she does not exist in the classroom i feel that very first day the babies need an environment where they feel secure and when i complained nobody listened or even care|0

we placed an order at just before up yesterday the delivery time was promised to be at 814pm i did not get the email that they had begun preparing until 830pm they had only begun preparing the pizza after the promised delivery time we called customer service to cancel the order as it was unacceptable for service to be this slow and we had guests over so we were going to buy some other food however after repeated calls to both the specific location which led to a general line anyway and the toll free number the call did not go through when it finally did go through customer service said we could not cancel so when the food arrives she said it would be given to us free of charge when the pizza finally arrived past up the delivery man called customer service to confirm that the pizza should be free and customer service said no despite telling us that it would be free half an hour before so we did not take the pizza this has been one of the worst customer service experiences weve ever experienced for 2 reasons unacceptably slow delivery and customer representatives who lie to get us off the phone|0

this place is such a horrible hospital 5 months ago i was shot in my home and brought there to be treated after having surgery i kept complaining that my back felt like it was bleeding and after two doctors told me i was fine my boyfriend soon saw that my entire back was covered in blood so bad that i had to ask the nurse to change my sheets that was the only time she cleaned my sheets the 4 days i was there they didnt help me shower or go to the bathroom thankfully my mother in law helped all of there nurses except one male nurse didnt even know what type of injury i had just knew i had a surgery on my arm because of a huge cast the intake team took my diamond ring and said they were keeping it in a safe deposit bag and i would get it when i was checking out when i asked for it a few days later they never had it the floor in my room was so dirty it was black and sticky when we asked if someone could come and clean it the lady came in without knocking slammed the door open didnt say a word and slammed a mop around the room and then just left again the only cleaning that i saw i couldnt see my surgeon for 15 days after my release date and they only sent me home with enough pain meds for 5 days after going to the emergency room they denied to even let me past the waiting room until i saw my surgeon now 5 months later im trying to call for an itemized bill and keep getting told to call billing where they keep transferring me to the same department the lady then tells me that theyve been training the past few months and that thats why i keep getting transferred wrong she said i can try calling back in an hour|0
fabulous food great service its a 10 star to me the best sausage gravy ive ever eaten this place had the best hash browns my wife has ever eaten according to her very clean the only fault is that the booths are somewhat small i only wish we lived closer so we could stop in more keep up the great work|1
what a rip off they tell you one thing charge you for it then when you get there to pick it up they change their tune and rip you off for more if you want the actual product after youve already paid for them to create a file chances are you will cave and go for it since you are already there creating a file is the cost of doing business and nobody else charges you extra for it in conclusion because of a mere 30 theyve lost a 700 account horrible way of doing business id say the best thing is still to go with a reputable real establishment as opposed to a hole in the wall of a flea market which thats what it is and all it will ever be never again|0
been here a bunch of times and every time has had great service chili food is always good too|1
i went to have a part installed the receptionist told me they didnt have time to do it that day and i would need to make an appointment for another day which i did upon return the subsequent day my car was in the shop for an hour at which time i was told that they had confirmed my diagnosis but still didnt have time to replace it so i would need to make yet another appointment i was also told they would charge 200 for the job that was 175 his per the shop manual that is nearly double the rates of other local shops and even more than the dealership service stinks and prices are horrendous stay away i ultimately took it to carolina car care who performed the repair for 91 without an appointment|0
when the time comes for a special event be it a wedding graduation birthday whatever this is a great place to go they have everything you need for any occasion even if its just finding stuff to gift on the holidays or stocking stuffers for family from out of town every time i go in the employees are impeccably nice helpful and polite im not the best at finding a good gift especially for those tough to find people but the employees have helped me anytime i ask and their suggestions have always been spot on this place has earned my business for the long haul incidentally i read the previous reviews above and im not trying to be rude but i have no idea what a couple of them were talking about why post a review for a business for a completely different business on the other side of town especially when you know its the wrong store dude seriously if your e going to take the time to post something at least post it on the right business these reviews can make a serious impact on peoples business and livelihood and its completely irresponsible to throw an unrelated party under the bus shame on you|1

from 72315 this smiths location is on west lake mead bled the setup of this store is like any typical chain of supermarkets the vegetable and fruit section had a good variety of produce and they were ripe not decaying like in some stores they have a decent booze section with a variety of wines and liquors their frozen aisle is huge with a good selection of ice cream pizzas veggies meals in a bag and even vegetarian options the seafood section was pretty decent there was a good selection of fishes shrimp scallops and crab legs score im so stoked that they have snow and king crab legs here plus the price was fine with me its what i am used to paying anyway the deli section had a bunch of good brands and my personal favorite boars head the meat section is excellent the quality of their steaks turkey chicken etc were very noticeable im just happy that i finally have a grocery store that i can see myself shopping at on a regular basis i moved out here five months ago and have been going walmart trader joes and el super but needed a grocery store like i am used to back in ny that said smiths seems like the winner even though their prices are slightly higher by a dollar or two i can actually find things i need if i really needed to get a bargain i know where to go|1

if i could give negative star i would give them 5 star our experience today was terrible my of and i went their with the 88 group on deal for the kobe beef dinner we originally bought it for the markham hilton location but that one closed down so they sent us to here we also upgraded 24 for the a burn sushi taster but the sushi quality was under par and worst than ay ce ther service was horrible and slow the a burn sushi was prepared and sitting at the counter and the slow blonde waitress was walking around doing random thing for a good 1520 min and we had to remind her we order the a burn sushi taster by the time it arrived it was ice cold and the favour sucked they just took normal sushi and torched it main dish kobe beef they just took a normal piece of steak and slapped it on the grill it was decent for a steak but i wouldnt call kobe beef after we finish our steak both our glasses was empty and she came clear away our dishes and silverware she walked back and forth 4 times by our table and didnt ask to refill our water we had to ask her lastly what put the nail in the coffin is when we got our bill they slapped on an automatic 15 20 tip for that service i was diff in idly not going to left her a tip i was soo pissed i just left the money on the table and left without complaining to the manager on duty i warn people stay away from this restaurant spend your money else ware like ja bistro or guu|0

i admit it im a book junky no seriously i love books i never get time to read all the books i buy old books new books character books business self help may be i need a book on how to read all the books i have ok back on point this is a gem in the awesome community of kensington are you a bookworm bibliophiles booklover if so then this is the place for you a wickedly charming space on two floors books you wont find at a big box retailer nor is there a so in the store speaking of which you can buy a book or ten here and then pop across the street to higher ground for a real coffee and a cookie and support yet another local business this place smells like a book store should it is that authentic the floors creak for extra character too lol literary genius is evident in every book you pick up kids books cook books novels technical books business they have it all perhaps 2 or 3 copies at most but who cares the selection is small and magical the staff are knowledgeable and so generous with their time to help you notebooks i love all the unique notebooks they have which is the reason i went in to the store in the first place what a great find ill be back over and over and you should be too support local we never want to lose this gem|1
awesome church i had attended impact before and loved it later i ended up moving so i tried to attend a church that we found closer to my new home but it just didnt do it for me and my family i sure missed impact the drive is definitely worth it great music great message nice people lots of groups to choose from things for the kids etc except one thing it looks like the in house rock star michael land is gone where is he so sad but the remaining singers are very good and get people moving regardless so if your e out there looking for the perfect church youll never find it because all churches are made of people and no one is perfect but if you want to find a great place of worship and to grow in your relationship with god this is a great place to do that|1

having dealt with substandard contractors and spending hours on the phone trying to resolve issues with our service agreement its not a home warranty theres a difference ive learned the hard way that the entire industry is a rip off 210s policy is to deny claims right off the bat even those that are legitimately undeniably covered after youve called back repeatedly they may dispatch a contractor but not the reputable kind that you would want to make repairs to your home more like the fly by night companies who are only able to continue their existence because of home warranty companies avoid this predatory industry and hire your own contractors in the end youll have peace of mind knowing the repairs will be done right and end up saving money over paying the annual fees for a service agreement that isnt worth the time youll spend scouring it to discover all the exclusions and limitations|0

do not i repeat do not use this company we called them to come look at a oven and refrigerator in our rental home after our home had a pipe burst and the kitchen had extensive damage upon looking at the oven we were told it would be better to buy a new one we kind of knew this as the oven was very old to begin with ok fine no big deal we were then told the issue with the refrigerator backing up of ice causing the entire freezer to fill with ice was due to a sensor we gave the go ahead to fix that and paid right away we were told at that time that this company guarantees their work here in lies the issue they guarantee their work because they will never respond to you when you try to contact them again because what they said was fixed wasnt i believe that the work was never performed in my home to begin with my husband myself and our tenants have all tried multiple times to reach this company leaving multiple voicemails to no avail nobody has called us back i have even threatened to contact my bank regarding the initial charge and still have not heard back this company will go out to your home right away to look at issues to appear as though they are a reliable company but will not respond when problems exist and you have already paid i see someone else has made the same comment as i about not being able to reach this company please do yourself a favor and do not use this company|0
i think my review is based mainly on the fact that im over the age limit to be in here we came about a month ago with some friends to go dancing we got all decked out had too many drinks at home and off we went the place is so crowded you cant move on the dance floor at all my husband is almost 65 and kept getting ran into by teeny tiny girls who had no regard for their surroundings or people around them after about an hour of this we headed out to another bar with less people and more room bottom line if you are under 25 or out on the town for a bachelorette party this is the place to be ride the mechanical bull dance in uncomfortable confines and shoes regret it in the morning if not head somewhere else|0
its clean inside but there was a pretty good line going at check out and the cashier was more interested on texting then actually doing her job and the manager was standing only a register away scanning new product|0

i went to the grand opening of this brand new sassing galaxy studio location here in las vegas nevada on september 28 2017 and it wasnt bad but here are my issues with this location 1 this store doesnt have a phone number how in the world can you have a flagship store and no way to contact it when you go to the sassing website and look under the galaxy studio locations you will see the phone number for this location click on directions gives the number to the caesars palace reservations department hates wow sassing com us galaxy studios when i called the number i was transferred from reservations to their regular customer service department but caesars palace doesnt have a phone number for this store because they dont have a landline thats just embarrassing especially when sassing wants to be considered on apples level at least all their stores have phone numbers 2 its fairly small i would say its smaller or about the same size as a gas station or convenience store this store has a few walls but many station so along with the overall size of the store it makes for a very cramped experience 3 its located on the strip street side right in front of the caesars palace casino so its great for tourist walking by but its a hassle for locals or anyone with a car you have to park in caesars palace parking which is in the very back of the casino then walk all the way through the casino and then out to the street to reach this store 4 this store doesnt have its own website section for updates or at least a facebook page for this location like they do for their new york city location i went to the store today october 3 2017 to do the sassing galaxy note 8 experience trial or buy it outright but the store was closed and the security guard in front of the store didnt even know why i asked when will it reopen and the security guard said she doesnt know plus no information was posted on the door come on sassing one positive the store is open 7 days a week from am to up when theyre open|0
this has to be one of the absolutely worst mexican food restaurant that i have been to came in starved had the guacamole 10 him thought quite steep for portion but if it was good quality portion size doesnt matter this just tasted very watery and the tomatoes on top were mushy and old which didnt add much to the dish this also was on a thursday not beginning of week the comp nacho chips and salsa were very nice we had ordered fish tacos and were told that people come there specifically for them i have to admit they were actually the worst i ever tasted and i love fish tacos is it because we came in around up the fish was so limp greasy and just not at all fresh tasting either so not sure when it was actually prepared earlier in day the cole slaw had no taste or flavor at all or crunch of any kind chilli rel enos looked great and were fine but then of the order was just onions bottled beer was good but margarita was so very watered down this was just a big disappointment overall i suggest trying some of the other mex cian restaurants in the city where freshness and quality play an important role in the food served|0
i had an appointment monday july 28 2014 when i called to book this appointment the person who answered was discreet and did not give me a welcome greet for a new client stil i went ahead and booked a facial mani pedi and repeatedly mention i was a new client i didnt want to judge from there and perhaps my service will go okay the appointment day when i sat down to get ready for my mani pedi i asked to get shellac done but was told i couldnt because there was a screw up on the booking not enough time because they were booked long repaired girl did my nails a bit messy but tolerable it fell apart within 2 days the end of the week i have a wedding to attend as for the facial no problem i was happy with the facial after going on the spas website and reading their services and what to expect as a new client i was disappointed what should have been done is that as a new client the owner she was there and who took my booking should have sat down with me or at least talked to me more on the phone at time of booking as a new client|0

do your homework before doing business with this company they have no guarantee or warranty on any of their work not only did they go way over budget with my engagement ring but it has literally fallen apart before our wedding date when we confronted the owner brian about all the issues he replied well we have to make money too whatever happened to making a quality product they are far too interested in making a buck needless to say its been a very stressful and disappointing situation you will not get what you paid for with brian at is jewelers|0
came here for my first time a couple of weeks ago and it is by far one of my favorite spots to go to staff is super friendly and knowledgeable|1
the manager is very unfriendly and rude my car broke down in the intersection outside of the store at 730am i pushed it out of the intersection and then was able to start it and pull into the parking lot of the klik mart while i was in the parking lot on my phone calling for assistance the manager became upset and aggressive he was angry that i was in the parking lot and hadnt gone inside to tell him what had happened i told him that i was sorry i hadnt told him and that my car had just broken down he didnt believe me he continued harassing me and said he would pull up the video cameras to prove i was lying to him i told him he could do that because the tapes would show my car stop in the intersection he continued to be upset and yell at me i told him the to i truck was on the way and i would be out of the parking lot soon but he demanded my car be removed i told him it was broken down and he refused to believe me eventually a good samaritan helped me out of the hostile situation prior to this incident i had been to this mart to purchase items but now i will never be returning here|0
after reading other reviews i see people have had the same problem as my family poor treatment we went in to order a birthday cake for my sister we just wanted the smallest size and were willing to pay for whatever when the price was giving to us it did seem a bit steep however in the end we didnt mind we just wanted a nice cake the owner proceeded to tell us that this wasnt a giant eagle bakery and if we wanted cheap cakes to go somewhere else my mother was in a we we were prepared to pay for the cake regardless but once spoken to like this we took our business elsewhere no one deserves to be treated with such disrespect from what i can tell from our experience and others the owner must have quite the ego and in all honesty after the business shut down for a few months to make changes the recipes arent as good anyway such a shame|0

deeply understaffed and unable to get you in any sooner than a 46 week time frame in most cases staff ive seen have been hit or miss and quite a few have been insensitive jerks i shouldve switched last year and didnt because i was so happy with one of my providers and didnt want to start over but now that shes booked until june im regretting it i initially chose them because they said they worked with a provider i had through my previous non hmo insurance and they wound up bullying me away from working with her just absolutely horrible especially for mental health care although for non mental health stuff there was also that time they went yep you have mono and shoved me out the door with backbones treatment and i wound up having to go to the er 2 days later so you know they just kind of suck all around|0

since you folks were contracted by a tour company to take us to the price is right in la from the northwest valley in az i can only review you based on the service we received from you and not the horrible service we received from the tour company it is unfortunate that proper communication did not happen between you and the tour company and to the passengers you were taking you could have pursued a bit more getting information from the tour company didnt seem to bother you that you also did not get correct info to even relay to the passengers my husband and i were your passengers along with 6 others we all were strangers but made friends luckily you were able to get a phone number to call us when we were already waiting for you in a different pick up area that the tour company did not tell you about so that was off to a real bad start right there we found the van but it was not marked at all no signs on it at all if this is a real business company you should have a sign on your vehicle brandy our driver said it is not a bus it is a van she said she is not the tour guide just the driver but on the hand out it said your driver tour guide is doug not present it was brandy his wife there was nowhere to put any bags it was an 11 passenger van and there were 8 of us plus driver no bag space told to put the bags under our legs no leg space this was an 8 hour trip 16 round trip to from la we were jam packed in this thing some of the bags went on the empty seats and a big tire iron was in the middle of the floor the van was filthy garbage in all the seat pockets filthy floor seats were ripped up seat belts did not work very unsafe the passenger door did not close right the stripping kept coming out and the ac did not work severe heat was coming out and it became hot was told after driver may be figuring out what it could be that going uphill it goes off cant imagine if this van went on trips thru the high desert heat hitting bumps the der was flashing and lights inside flashing made lots of noises had dents inside and out driver said the vehicle was maintained recently this vehicle was no way worthy of being on any roads at all let alone this company being responsible for its passengers on trips safety first should have been off the road a few years ago driver brandy mentioned this would be the last trip for it that made us all feel real good there were seniors on this trip who did have issues getting in and out which was not easy at all was strange going thru the border checkpoint may be if a company sign would have been on the van the agent wouldnt have asked questions he did see 8 passengers in this packed van she did not take us as promised in the flyer to all the places that were mentioned passengers were asking to stop for dinner in hollywood like it said in the flyer but that was a bust also just took us back to the very bad hotel in a bad area which was provided by the tour company and we paid for but again still not taken to where we supposed to be taken may be brandy was tired and just wanted to end that day journey you must remember we all paid for the tour and you were to get us to those points that were promised instead all we did was drive by i of whatever she could show us from the van advice to you first do not deal with that tour company any more second do not put unsafe vehicles on the road|0

i once chided people on reviewing chains though it was at a time where there was some type of drive to review a shiz ton of places and everyone began banging out reviews of subways i have since rec in ded that belief as i think that giving props to a chain that goes a bit above and beyond can be just as valuable as turning in a with review of a place that everyone already goes to so my lovely companion and i were on the way to check out texas chainsaw massacre the musical at the new blank canvas theatre we were running kind of late but were both starving right at the corner to turn toward the theater we see the burger king standing there sheepishly i said something like wanna just get burger king she agreed and started confessing her addiction to their chocolate shakes i have to say i stopped going to the be a while back as i had thought they went way downhill across the board however i got two cheeseburgers she got a double and all three were incredibly tasty i had been a bit nervous as after rush fast food burg i sometimes tend to sit a while but all had clearly been made right then the shakes were awesome a bit thicker than meds standard shakes the gal at the drive through was remarkably pleasant i wanted to tell her to hang in there and in 1520 years shed be a district manager of be making twice what most people with masters degrees make but the show was starting soon and we had to demolish our food hopefully she already understands that so a pretty solid be dont be afraid to hit it up|1

i have dealt with this family a few times with the exception of the one son that runs the fisherman drive location i would say that they are reasonable and honest people that being said stay away from the fisherman drive shop he is an arrogant rude know it all he has his mechanics licence but he has no concept of proper mechanics he actually told me once that automobile air conditioning uses the gas and has to be replenished every year no amount of discussion would convince him otherwise last year they had a wag jag oil change and inspection special that i took advantage of i was informed that i needed new rear brakes on my 2005 honda odyssey i have always done my own brakes but at the ripe age of 65 i decided i would let them do the job what a fiasco when i picked up my van great vehicle by the way the brakes pulsate i and made an awful noise i returned it and was told they have to be broken in again a comment from someone that doesnt have a clue he took my van for a test drive and drove it like a madman hammering on the brakes hoping that the problem would resolve itself it didnt in the end they replaced the rotors which i had told him was the problem and everything was good a mere 6 months later and the same thing is happening i took the van over and he said there must be a problem with the hydraulic line long story short lol shorter i would never take my vehicle to him again he has no clue i am going to buy honda parts and do the repair myself|0

this was the worst comedy i have ever attempted to sit through there was potential for actual jokes but the hosts shut them down immediately as it was clear they did not want to be shown up by legitimate comedians i would love to have heard a punchline but sadly i was disappointed if your e in the market to watch a bunch of insecure comedians take a break from watching porn in their moms basement to harass actual funny people for what seems like an interminable evening this is for you i wish zero stars was an option|0
dominos pizza is pretty good but the lakewood oh location has terrible service when i went in for pickup i was ignored because they had so many deliveries then when i went to pay the cashier kept my change that was awkward most recently i got an email for 20 off entire order with online delivery the headline said we miss you so of course theres an error message prompting us to call the restaurant where ultimately our order went from 40 to 49 after the manager explained they were out of pineapples and would not honor our coupon after their worker said they would we ended up cancelling our order and going to another local pizza place dominos as a whole has done a great job of improving their menu and recipes but my local spot is too disappointing to try again|0
i love subway but this review is specifically for the new panini sandwiches and this particular store i had a coupon where you buy a drink and get a free panini i got one of the chicken panini subway has been promoting like crazy lately the panini had chicken ham spinach and tomato with honey mustard as the only sauce on it they dont allow you to do modifications or add extra sauce you can ask them to skip the ham or sauce if you want there is no option on the kind of bread you want it on as well the panini i are placed at a price you can get a foot long sub of the day at my sub with all the customizations with the toppings and sauce i have a couple of other coupons but will not use them because these panini i are the worst i have ever had the place had three girls and they didnt say a word and were not welcoming it looked as if they are doing me a favor making the sandwich|0
i wanted to give this business no stars but the program wouldnt let me i am so mad at this company i ordered 250 custom can lids for my business to give to my clients i run a pet sitting company in chicago before i ordered i did all my due diligence i had them send me a sample of the product assessed the quality and made sure it fit all the possible cans my customers might have and it did so i placed the order and what i got instead was garbage the lids are too tight to fit on the most popular size cans 5 oz if you push them down with all your might the lid pops off on the opposite side it is impossible to use and i see my clients not using them instead theyre buried in drawers or thrown away who knows i certainly wouldnt want them cluttering up my kitchen they make my company look second rate and cheap and we are anything but now im left with probably 200 can lids sitting in my closet i called the company to let them know and they had my rep give me a call apparently i had had them too long to replace them not that i wanted any more of their products buyer beware inexcusable bait and switch tactics being used dont trust anything they say|0
i just moved to to and needed a new salon they had a group on so i decided to give them a shot the group on did not provide the service it said it would and i was only told once i was in the seat their definition of straightening is apparently a keratin straightening treatment that they claim keeps your hair straight for 4 months but actually only smooths frizz and you still need to straighten everyday blatant deception they charged me 80 dollars for a dry hair cut do people even do that the hairstylist was nice but i wasnt happy with the cut or the treatment she spent the whole time checking her cell phone to ensure she had a ride home which made me feel rushed i called to complain and got put on hold for more than 10 mins twice at which point i hung up and then i wrote a polite email indicating my concerns and hoping we could work something out they never bothered to respond the section of the salon i saw was also noticeable dusty so i am not sure what their cleaning routine is if you value your hair go anywhere else|0
top notch class act they are worth having them make the trip to your home professional folks they truly care about your furry family|1
the bakery might have taken into account the previous reviews here on yelp because i had no issue with the speed of service and attentiveness of the ladies working there i had questions regarding just what 56 of the cakes were since nothing was labeled and the lady very patiently explained them to me i bought a tiramisu slice and burnt almond torte that came to a total of 548 i have a major sweet tooth seriously i survive on sweets for lunch most days and only eat properly for dinner and felt like a kid in a candy shop or bakery i suppose when looking while nothing seemed particularly novel there was quite a large variety of items and one of the more interesting ones was a spherical apple dumpling which apparently had a baked apple inside there were also cannoli eclairs baklava cheesecake carrot cake parfaits and creme pies to name a few more that i can remember the other side of the store had cookies but i had less interest in those so i dont recall anything else except the additional presence of chocolate gobs and thumbprints donuts in the case next to them looked to be 34 gone as only the top rack were left it was around 2 am may be i was just particularly hungry that day but the items i bought were some of the most fresh and creamy cakes ive had with just the right flavor to satisfy me without being too overpowering the burnt almond torte had a layer of custard cream filling in it which i was pleasantly surprised by the almonds covering it had just the right amount of crunch to them and the cream was soft and somewhat dense i cant recall much about the cake part since the other elements took the spotlight but i dont think it was particularly airy though it was very good as well the tiramisu was so flavorful at that point i was about 5055 full though and thats when i stop tasting food quite as carefully so i dont quite remember details regarding individual components other than the fact that the most bottom coffee layer under the ladyfingers had just the right amount of moisture and that the texture and taste of every part of the cake came together very well its also important to note that this is my first yelp review so the fact that i signed up just to discuss this bakery speaks for itself|1
planned on a family lunch at the red herring but it was unfortunately closed due to some sort of emergency went to the illing union instead since we did not have much time to eat from the poor restaurant selection in the union three of us chose rice garden and ordered the lunch special one entree rice an egg roll and a soda however when we ordered we were told that the only rice we could have was the white rice not the fried rice and that although teriyaki chicken was there it was not included in the lunch special two of us had kung pao chicken the other orange sesame chicken portions of the entree were small the food regrettably was bland my wife said nothing about her sesame chicken and the kung pao i had was flavorless and had none of the heat usually associated with the dish bland food small portions and menu items excluded from the lunch special never again if we had had a little more time we would have ventured into any one of several restaurants on green street which would have unquestionably provided us a better lunch|0
ive only been once and would never return the pizza was subpar plus i noticed the guy behind the counter handled my money and then worked the next pizza without washing his hands ugh|0
bad business ethics and unsafe homeowner instructions i called atkins bee removal on a wednesday to solve a bee swarm issue under a garage roof eave in the queen creek san tan valley area of arizona lance said he would come out thursday but was a no show until friday after filing the eave gaps with liquid nails and covering the vent screen with insulation material to prevent the bees from reentry lance set a bee trap for returning bees on a string hung it over a nail attached to the eave and tied the balance of the string to a nearby branch i was instructed to come back later that night untie the string from the branch and lower the bee trap into a garbage bag and dispose of the bees myself im not sure why i should be responsible for that when im paying him to remove the bees or if its even legal to dispose of bees in that way but thats what he instructed me to do when i get there the bees are on the garage wall near the eave in a massive ball adjacent to the trap but not in the trap i called lance to suggest the trap may need to be hung away from the garage wall so the bees could be contained to just the trap instead of the wall his response was i dont know what anyone did but the trap was full of bees before i left so 1 why didnt he remove the trap while he was still there and 2 who in the hell would remove bees from a trap which is what was being inferred anyway i told him i would check on the trap the following day to see it the bees might have moved from the wall to the trap when i arrived saturday night there must have been 10000 bees surrounding the trap so many in fact that you couldnt even see the trap lance still expected me to lower the trap into the garbage bag impossible at this point i texted him and told him it was too dangerous for me especially since i dont own a bee suit and again why i should i be doing something im paying him to do i hear nothing from lance after my text message until the following day its now sunday and i get a series of unprofessional texts from lance saying that he went out of his way to come back to the property to remove the trap that i was supposed to remove out of your way this is what your e paid to do fool and you could care less about my safety are you nuts then he kept pressing me to spend 450 more to remove the remaining comb and said i would be endangering my tenants if i didnt let him cut through the roof to remove the comb what removing the comb isnt a bad idea and i plan on having the work done but i would never let this guy do it he then rants on and on about how awful i am about not letting him remove the comb and how bad my decision is to ignore his request mind you he rants continuously about my character in a very long winded series of text messages this was worse than listening to a condo timeshare salesman after telling him your e not interested on angles list atkins bee removal claims to have an a with the bob but when i went to the bob site it says that his business is not bob accredited and has a i rating go figure they also write that they have 100 positive reviews on every search engine well we know thats not true unless he doesnt count yelp and the better business bureau you be the judge but i will never use atkins bee removal service again or his alternate name pristine enterprises lac|0
first good luck finding any employees in the store and if you do be prepared for them to look right at you waiting at the register and walk away twice this happened most know baron brothers is over priced and having anything framed there is the equivalent to having a car stereo installed at best buy be prepared for some underpaid idiot to screw it up i learned from experience to go elsewhere for that most recently i went in reluctantly looking for offset clips used to frame a canvas painting in a frame they didnt have the size i needed which sucks but not a big deal but then they convince me to buy some other junk promising me it will work i told them i didnt think it was the right type of thing but they assured me it was so of course here i set with 10 worth of hardware that doesnt do what i need it to do and since theyre 20 minutes away and finding an employee in the store takes another 10 minutes im not going to bother to go back and return it bad customer service lack of industry knowledge and complete apathy towards customers makes this place something to avoid the baron brothers on sunset just closed for being the same type of business i dont imagine it will be long before this ones gone too good riddance oh and their hours are off on here theyre only open til 7 on weeknights|0

i never write reviews but this place was so bad that i feel the need to share my experience my boyfriend and i went here last saturday after going to the one in middleburg a month ago for a cornhole tournament im a vegetarian and the online menu and menu at middleburg had many options for me we walked into the parma location and it was a ghost town no one in the front to greet us walked to the bar where two other couples were sitting and no bartender to be seen after a few minutes the girl came and got our drink orders and we asked for menus she hands us a laminated piece of paper front side only burger wings pizza nachos thats it i said may be we should go somewhere else to eat and she replied i dont blame you what ordered shots she disappeared for 10 mins til she finally came back and brought our shots she also overcharged our beer a dollar we paid our tab and left went to red circle to eat and drink where we were taken very good care of never going back here you have all been warned|0
i hate to be one of the people that write a review and not even have experienced their service but when a business calls wanting to get an estimate for a plumbing issue and gets nothing but a rude attitude from the person who answers the phone that really makes your company look bad and its really your loss because had i received the kind of service any potential customer should have receive and you did good work you would have had pel nty for years to come|0
avoid this place we purchased a deal on group on and they were extremely shady about it the group on deal included a waffle two cappuccinos or lattes two teas two large desserts four biscotti i and four meringue cookies when we arrived we ordered the teas flavoured lattes and waffles after the teas arrived we informed the server that we had a group on she became very agitated that we did not make a reservation and began questioning i about this it was very uncomfortable the waffle arrived 15 minutes later and it was really good at that point the server informed me that the group on does not include cappuccinos or lattes even though the deal said specifically that they are included in the package she tried to tell me that i can get two small coffees instead i decided that i was going to hold my ground and asked for my two flavoured lattes she refused and i was forced to argue with her for what seemed like 10 minutes she left and returned 10 minutes|0

update i am now giving them one star i got a call from the manager the following day she sounded very agitated and was very short with me i have stayed calm and patient through this whole ordeal and was surprised at her attitude she said she looked the frames over and there were one or two hair line surface scratches on the frames she felt that they were not that damaged and that they were good enough for me to take home i said they should not have any scratches at all and should be brand new obviously they took the scratched up lenses out of the new frames and now the frames were scratched too there was also some sort of discoloration on the frame that attached to the left lens and i could see a shadow she said that she couldnt replace the frames with new ones because they did not have any more in stock so take them or leave them or i can have a full refund she never offered to have me select a different frame in the store and i felt like i was being dismissed none of the incidences were my fault and she made me feel like i was the problem and that she could not wait to be rid of me i accepted the refund|0
i ordered the dillinger with a side of fries and grabbed a diet coke im not fond of thyme reminds me of hospital meatloaf that is not i angers fault of course but i think the fries should be less spiced as it competes with the hamburger and when theres too rich a flavour you cant finish them i did not finish the fries this never happens also the fries were slightly mealy i dont mind less crispy fries as mentioned by other reviewers but they better be good and i should at least want to finish em the hamburger was okay honestly i prefer hero burgers i like the atmosphere the friendly staff and the gangster trivia running on the screen above the counter how 2400 was spent by some ganster on just the rubber bands to keep blocks of cash together but the food just wasnt enough to bring me back i eagerly await the opening of burger priest a block east|0

newly opened restaurant same as the great links on west craig thats been around a while this new great links is next to ellis aft in the same location that was a blueberry hill for years and then a short lived korean biq the great links over on craig serves great food and is well run can not say the same here average food at best extremely slow service still waiting for a burger and fries after 30 minutes i came in three weeks ago right after they opened second time is today and it has not improved dont expect they will stay open long without improvements in all areas|0
old equipment and rustic furnishings no wifi about 10 of equipment out of service on the balance this place works in a pinch but its not attractive or noteworthy for anything other than parking availability|0
horrible experience ordered a deep dish and a hot and ready they made our deep dish and forgot to cook our wings once it was ready so our deep dish sat there for min as we had to wait another 1015 for our wings to top it off the employees laughed at the whole thing blaming each other not an apology or any kind of sympathy ill drive a little further next time for better customer service hopefully no cold pizza this time they also forgot our sauces horrible experience and customer service|0

the soon to be husband and i wanted a new car mostly we wanted to save on the ridiculous gas prices we a vow toured but the toured for lack of a better term sucks when it comes to gas consumption anyway arm in arm we went off to the car hunt we kind of had an idea of what we wanted it needed to be 4 cylinder small 4 door with enough cargo space to carry my copious amounts of crap we looked at the nissan versa honda fit even a kia soul but ultimately i wanted another volkswagen so we started looking at getting either a jetty or a golf the fiance had a jetty previously we found the perfect golf rabbit ii it was the smoky gray color i wanted had all the options overall it was exactly what i wanted we test drove it and while it drove like the fiance i previous jetty there were cosmetic issues that i absolutely needed fixed on it before i even talked about making a deal with them whomever had this car before us apparently was a 20 something jersey shore wannabe because it had the darkest aftermarket tint i have ever seen west of seaside heights not only that it was the worst applied after market tint ive seen said jersey shore wannabe was also a smoker albeit not a careful one it had burn holes in the back seat and on the driver seat which while repairable still annoyed me the cup holder in the back seat was broken in pieces and put in the trunk who does that and last but not least the car had apparently only been vaccuum ed out and then put on the lot spitzer put absolutely no thought in detailing it and making it showroom lot acceptable so i brought up my concerns to our sales guy and he said to me well its a used car you cant expect too much excuse me about 85 of americans buy used cars not only that but this was a 16000 used car not some 15 year old chevy cavalier that i was buying for my 16 year old kid to go and wreck in a year i stated as much and said that if he wanted our business those things needed to be fixed he agreed that they could be fixed and we said wed be in monday to talk numbers we went on a saturday i will say after that wretched first impression i went home and went hunting for a vow golf rabbit ii that was comparable to the one that i liked i came up with nothing and resigned myself to buying this from spitzer we go back in on monday we purchased the car financing in place i reiterated my requirements to have the things on this car fixed asap our sales guy said that the cup holder was ordered and that he would call us to make an appointment to have the tint removed and the cup holder fixed fast forward a week later and no followup to get that piece fixed i finally call him and he sounded surprised to hear from me not a good sign he says he needs to find out what day the guy that does the tint comes in and hell call me back think he called me back if you guessed no your e right we ended up having to go in the following monday to bring in a form that they needed for the financing which i might add we did of own volition because the bank had called us i made it very clear that this needed to be done now i made an appointment to bring it in the next monday i bring it in and they give me loaner for the day they give me a saturn aura with no gas a vow dealership gives me a saturn aura as a loaner with no gas i as the customer had to put gas in a loaner car tell me how that makes any sense at all i come back at the end of the day and i am told that they are bringing my car around in about 15 minutes would i mind just waiting thats fine i sat there for an hour people were starting to go home and i was still sitting there no one checked on me gave me any updates nothing im so pissed at this point but thankfully my car showed up and the icing on top of this crap pile of a car buying experience was that our car only came with one key let me iterate that this was a 16000 car once again not a chevy cavalier and we only got one key our sales guy pretty much told us too bad whatever we need two keys so we have to spend more money to buy a and volkswagen key which are not cheap it ran us to the tune of 200 for a key oh yeah and we have to get the car detailed on our own too lets not forget that i will never buy another car from any spitzer owned dealership again in fact i hope their dealerships go out of business they have the worse customer service follow up and salesmanship of any dealership i have ever been too stay far far far away from this one the vow dealership we bought our toured from i could rave about for days they were that good this vow dealership needs some training or needs to be shut down i prefer the latter|0

dear epic you have rapidly gone from my favorite thrift store in the whole world to one of the worst thrift stores in vegas i hear its because of a young suit that you put in office who decided to remove more than half of the items at the store part of the greatness about epic thrift was the fact that i could go and treasure hunt for hours on end the store just looks pitiful and sad i went from spending 4 hours in here to spending just about 20 minutes i am so disappointed i tried the one on decatur only to find the same sad sorry results bring back the variety so long epic hello pathetic only at epic|0
i went to uptown bridal based on some recommendations i had received i had already been to a few bridal boutiques in scottsdale but when i first arrived at uptown i knew they were different the shop is beautifully decorated very light and i was immediately greeted by ali one of the bridal consultants they were very helpful in making recommendations and i ended up finding the dress their fitting area is perfect to see all angles of the dresses they have ac in each room which was amazing considering it was june they are extremely reasonably priced and dont try to push you to buy a 5000 dress during my search for my perfect dress i visited many boutiques and uptown bridal is definitely the only 5 star worthy place in town ask for ali shes so helpful and very sweet and honest thanks uptown pics to follow|1

when i moved to ajax this was the first nail salon i started going to i went a couple of times and my nails looked great but a friend of mine who already lived in ajax told me about a cheaper salon so i started getting my nails done there however i still chose to go to this salon for other services excluding nails i have found that on every occasion ive been there for other services the man at the front desk who i am assuming is the owner or manager has been extremely rude there have been plenty of times where i would call ahead to ask if there was someone available for a certain service and he would tell me yes and once i showed up hed have me waiting for an hour and say the person is busy and to come back if i dont call ahead and walk in asking for a service other than nails his demeanour changes and he becomes very short with me i think the other services i get are great and the people that do them are amazing but this bully at the front desk completely ruins the experience as a paying customer he should learn to treat everyone the same and practice good customer service im debating if i even want to continue going there there are too many nail salons in ajax to have to deal with such bullshit all the time|0

service i was given two hair dressers to work with me instead of one needless to say this made things awkward i had my head leaning down for a good 30 minutes while these two women talked over me putting in highlights they pretty much just ignored the fact that i was there and gossiped about all of the other workers in the store directly in front of me when they werent gossiping they were speaking some type of asian dialect to one another they made me feel like i was at some nail salon the owner of the salon was also there he went on about how great his salon was in reality the service was bad and for the prices i could have gotten a massage and coffee at a good hair salon in toronto colour the highlights turned out looking nice prices i was annoyed by the pricing this girl tried to tell me that it was an extra 20 dollars just to blow dry my bangs what a joke i ended up paying close to 200 dollars for the highlights and then was expected to tip two girls who said i wanted both to begin with i think i tipped 3 dollars between the two of them for their un professionalism|0

this dealer may give you a sense that you wont be cheated and that their cars are good but that is not the case they buy a lot of their cars from auctions and dont even fix them up they over price the cars by thousands within a month there is a good chance that the car will stop running and then they will charge you to fix it they dont disclose information that they are required to tell you and might even neglect to let you know if the car didnt pass a smog test if the car does brake down shortly after buying it they will attempt to get you into another overpriced car that will also eventually brake down and if all that isnt enough they will also kindly let you know that they will require you to pay for the repairs to the previous broken down car so they can turn around and sell it to some new sucker|0

capsule is definitely the worst sneaker store in and around toronto period if your down to play into the hype beast then this place is for you everyone else look elsewhere to satisfy your sneaker desires if your going to call your self a sneaker boutique the least you guys could do is actually carry the standard range of mens shoe sizes 813 the fact that you guys consistently never carry size 13 in your biggest brands basics new balance nike makes your boutique a complete joke i have asked in the past why they dont carry size is and have been told that our suppliers usually dont have any size is for the canadian market so if they are unavailable we can not get them other sneaker shops in toronto dont seem to have the same difficulty in getting size is which must mean capsule gets the end of the line selections or they stash away the size is before they hit the shelves if you want to buy sneakers in toronto i would check out sole stop livestock sip groovy and ugly duckling all except for ugly duckling located at yonge and funds and sole stop located in pacific mall are located within a few blocks of the queen and sparing intersections before making your way to the over hyped capsule sneaker less boutique|0
i had originally moved here to granite bay in late 2013 my experience at that time was far from great before rent was even due i had a notice on my door of possible eviction it turns out that granite bay was being sold to a different leasing company and the previous owners were issuing notices left and right i would agree to the reviews done that year and prior my calls messages and questions were ignored but since the new buyout with the current leasing company with granite bay i have nothing but great things to say this is a large complex so there are things bound to go wrong and after reading more recent reviews all i can say is how can they fix it if they dont know its broken i did see a roach at one point and called into the office who immediatly schedule ed a spray i havent had any problems since they have routine weekly spraying to keep on top of everything its impossible for every resident to be dream residents so of course things will happen but the staff and maintain ce crew are quick on the draw and stay on top of it ive had other random maintenance issues that popped up from a electric plug being wired akward ly to being locked out of my place because my key was worn but i have always recieved quick and friendly service the office staff are my favorite people on the complex theyre always super friendly and understanding they know my name and greet me every time they see me which is often now since i get so many packages the maintenance crew are also super nice and professional the apartments are nice and are at a great price i also love being just a few blocks from the 17 so i can get quick access to anywhere in the valley there are several pools around the complex that are kept very clean and i do enjoy the excercise room that is in the leasing office i have yet to try the sun a but i shall very shortly i recommend this complex to everyone that i hear looking for a place|1

this is a new market deli in the regent neighborhood that specializes in meal kits and to go dinners they had a soft open this last week we tried their first to go weds dinner both a meat based one and a vegetarian one there was one choice for each we appreciated the locally sourced food and ingredients the meal was healthy and flavorful and even better for lunch on the second day the dessert was the best part super yummy the online ordering option was appreciated we could not pick up our dinner until 5 am a little earlier would have been helpful for those of us who have littles that are used to an early dinner cost was high 70 for five meals but the convenience can not be beat it was also a lot of food we fed seven people with five meals and still had leftovers there are some kinks to work out but overall we were pleased and felt this was a good addition|1

perfect smoked salmon to be enjoyed very fresh because krista i sons is cold smoked using a bare minimum of other ingredients it is not salty and does not need cream cheese to cut any salty flavor traditional lox is primarily salt preserved and very salty hence this smoked salmon is not lox cold smoking is also very healthy preserving vital omega fats your body and brain needs for effective metabolism this is smart food krista i sons is mild and tasty enough to enjoy very simply on a platter with a generous squeeze of organic lemon and fresh ground pepper may be some paper thin shavings of very fresh red onion like your e eating sashimi or carpaccio to me thats better than the puffy bun and capers etc etc alternatively could omit the do using of lemon juice and nosh the salmon along with white wine because strong acids and wine do not play well together expensive ish i think nearly doubled in cost the past ten years but then so did your ga home value you still need to eat well and theres far worse ways here bon app it|1

yes yes yes yes yes yes after a horrible experience at city tavern my friend had the brilliant idea of stopping at hawthorne i to grab some grub and a beer best decision ever upon our arrival the manager greeted us at the door and sat us at a booth our server carter was wonderful and immediately offered us something to drink we all got a round of waters and then each ordered a drink drink my friends both ordered appetizers one had fried calamari and the other ordered fried jalapeno peppers laura loved the calamari it was a huge portion my other friend wasnt too thrilled with the jalapenos but at this point we were starving so he ate some anyway we ordered a large pizza to be split three ways half meat lovers and half luau it was delicious carter continuously checked in on us upon finishing our meals the manager asked us how everything was and we said it was excellent my guy friend told carter that he wasnt really satisfied with the jalapenos and she actually got those taken off of his bill which was very kind but not necessary we gushed over our service and she relayed the information to brandon the manager he then offered to get us a dessert on the house by the way the tiramisu is amaze balls carter was also very honest as far as what she recommended and what she didnt care for she also brought my friend the house cabernet rather than the more expensive one because they tasted identical we will definitely be returning and requesting carter|1
like i said before which was removed sadly if you enjoy a good bar fight with a bunch of drunk roofers then the tipsy cow should be your destination of choice the owners have no control over their patrons which usually end up yelling screaming and fighting every friday and saturday night up and down main street what else can i say flies are attracted to shit|0

i was there the last week of may 2015 and was pleasantly surprised i actually hesitated going to this location after having read some marginal reviews but i was close and short on time boy am i glad i did the service was prompt and professional in addition to the basics i have a front piece of plastic that sits under the bumper that is slightly loose and i asked if they could fix it and while they didnt have the parts to do so they inspected it thoroughly and said if i returned with some zip ties they would be willing to stitch me up for free excellent service experience|1
delicious italian food this is an excellent option if you want to dine off of the vegas strip its a bit more relaxing and low key we ordered a bunch of appetizers and entrees and shared family style my favorite dish had to be the lobster ravioli it was smothered in a delicious white cream sauce and filled with succulent lobster chunks i also loved the grilled sea bass the toasty grilled flavor was slight but what stood out the most was the tender laziness of the fish perfection the accompanying bed of saute i spinach tasted wonderful with a squeeze of lemon juice clam linguine was alright the pasta was al dente and the sauce was quite light the clams were of a generous size and it was quite convenient having the small seafood fork to remove the meat from the shell the crab cakes were a bit dry perhaps they deep fried it for too long it wasnt moist also loved the tomato bisque it was served very hot and stayed hot for a while the creaminess of the soup balanced out the acidic tomato taste very good combination expect the seafood entrees to run around 3035 the appetizers run anywhere from 815 we were here for quite a while and i noticed that the longer we took to eat the slower the service got lol so slow that when we wanted to order dessert it took forever for them to come back until we finally just said well have to pass on dessert we had a show in downtown la to catch|1

this is by far hands down and without a doubt the worst food of any kind that ive ever seen at a restaurant i got the house chicken and it was bone dry it looked like they i completely forgotten the sauce altogether i mentioned it to them when i was taking it back for a refund and she seemed to think that the sauce was now just under the chicken or had been absorbed by the rice id looked under the chicken and there was not one mili meter of sauce there id tried the small amount of rice that was browned by some substance and i could barely stomach it i have never in my life returned oriental food to the store before today aside from the terrible food the restaurant itself is a dive i will never consider eating here again|0

i had the worst medical experience i have ever had here this place functions as a factory trying to get as many people in and out as possible after checking in i waited and was never called after speaking to the receptionist she informed me the doctor was too behind and that i would have to reschedule or use their immediate care physician i saw their immediate care physician do du ram and she was very disrespectful first off and then she acted like a robot the entire time i would never recommend this facility to anyone save time and frustration by choosing a different medical group entirely|0

for those who enjoy italian and really who doesnt then you are not limited to pizza especially when there are exquisite italian restaurants like prop it was a friday night and we were out with another couple so i was forced to order fish but i was not disappointed we shared shrimp crostini salmon ricotta crostini and grilled sardines as an appetit dizer im sure the other couple ate more than their share the apps were thoughtfully prepared and abundant in fish not to mention that having such a variety of fish to choose from is a rarity the mains no sharing we had a hearty fish stew grilled salmon and the special spi gold and sea bream wow this isnt even a seafood restaurant we were overwhelmed the fish properly cooked showing off the true flavour and proper texture of the fish beautifully prepared but its not just seafood its a fine italian dining at very reasonable pricing i watched other tables enjoy a liver dish and risotto nero a black ink risotto the portions are filling and you dont feel bloated and the freshness and quality of the dishes sets prop ahead of some of the other restaurants in the neighbourhood|1

went to blue cave last night for dinner local flavor had a coupon so i decided to try it inside the place is kind of dumpy and dirty the entire time we were there two employees sat at a gest table with multiple empty drink cup on the table they kept bothering one of the servers which slowed down service to her tables our server was injured and only had use of one arm she was able to bring us glasses of water and my wife a glass of wine which was a generous pour but said she couldnt bring me my drink a martini and some else would bring it it came 15 minutes later and was not what i ordered we had wings they were very average at best i had the carolina burger it was not seasoned way overcooked the bun was either stale or over warmed because it was crunchy and twice the size of the meat the burger was flavorless the burger came with chips they were ok my wife had the loaded chips she gave them 2 out 5 stars even at half price i will never return i bet it doesnt last 3 months|0
wont be going back because extremely high prices and management is poor i have found many i ape smoke shops that are much better thats for dang sure they are a rip off and have bad attitudes avoid them unless you are really hard up and nothing else is open lol even then i think the 711 would probably be more pleasant|0
the positive they have a good selection of some interesting and beautiful dresses the less than positive the service was quite lackluster in that they seemed so hands off that it felt like they didnt care that much i was also unimpressed by their assumption that i was straight marrying a man and apparent shock confusion when i corrected the gender of my partner after more than a decade of same sex marriage in canada you would think that bridal salons would be careful not to assume the gender of your future spouse it definitely made me think twice about spending my money there|0
go somewhere else this place is definitely overrated we ordered bul goi gam ja tang and sam eye tang bul goi was okay gam ja tang was the worst ive ever had before and for sam eye tang there was only half chicken ive been to different places for korean food there are lots of better korean restaurants in that area just skip this one it will destroy ur interests in korean food|0

the worst service in oakland ordered a burrito bowl with steak and received may be half a scoop about 67 cubes of steak and politely asked for a little more considering its supposed to be 8 worth and was told i would have to pay double meat to receive anymore there was a very short line unlike how packed it usually is so i had commented on why accommodations throw a couple cubes of steak on top couldnt have been made to receive a reasonable amount of protein but was given attitude and eye rolling when i went to pay i stood around the cashier for a while because they had refused to hand me my food slide it across the counter to indicate it was mine my friend i was with had also tried to ask for more chicken as she had received a very little amount as i did since she had only ordered a salad very poor customer service very small amounts of food|0
in september 2009 our ac unit stopped working i called a few companies including diamondback air and talked to the owner john herman he was very helpful over the phone so i agreed to have his technician come out the next day to take a look at my unit when he arrived he determined that the fan motor had seized up and needed to be replaced luckily it was under warranty so it should have been a quick and inexpensive fix the technician called john for a quote and he quoted me 485 485 to replace a fan motor that was under warranty and would only take 30 or so minutes to replace and that was on top of the service fee i had to pay i immediately called john myself and he gave me some song and dance trying to justify the ridiculous cost i told him i would hire someone else i paid them their 70 service fee and sent the technician on his way i immediately called several other well known reputable companies and got quotes over the phone to replace the motor all the quotes were several hundred dollars less than what john had tried to get out of me the next morning another company came out and replaced the motor and was in and out in under an hour they charged me 110 total im just sorry diamondback air got 70 of my money in my opinion john herman and diamondback air have shady business practices i dont know if john felt he could prey on someone because it was hot and may be i was desperate enough to pay the money to have my ac work again or if it is because i am female and he thought i wouldnt know any better either way i am disgusted by the whole thing i also found out afterwards that their license was suspended at the time i advise everyone to stay far away from this company there are far more honest businesses out there that will get the job done professionally without attempting to rip off their customers|0

my husband and i were really looking forward to the new chinese restaurant we went on a friday night the place was empty but there was loud talking and cooking sounds coming from the kitchen as if the place was packed i order sesame chicken with lo main and soup my husband ordered beef and broccoli we waited forever for our food again we were the only people in there the food arrived in take out containers which was fine however the food was hot temperature hot it was inedible we waited a while and blew on it to cool down still it was scorching hot i burnt the roof of my mouth trying to eat a piece of chicken the food was bland so my efforts were for nothing my husbands food was just as bland and tasteless then they brought us out soup which again was to hot even after blowing on it im sure there is a health violation for serving food at 900 degrees i think the only way to get the food that hot is by a microwave we wont be back ever china go go is china no no|0

although check in seemed fast and easy rest of stay wasnt good they never cleaned the room or brought more coffee which is important and i did not leave the do not disturb sign out then last night my key light the green light on the door do get into my room but it felt like the mechanism inside was sticky and binding when i turn the handle down or up i tried about 10 times before it worked today it seemed to work on the first time but i did feel a little binding inside i want to the front desk and the owner lady had an attitude immediately that there wasnt any problem with the door and walk me down and used her card and it worked i did tell her that it seemed intermittent and it worked fine just now but last night it was quite difficult to get in and suggested may be a little lubrication she immediately became confronted and had an attitude i just simply explained i was just kindly letting them know that may be they should take a look at it when she was very rude and disrespectful i dont know why i was very polite and pleasant to her the room on the other hand was nice enough it did have a refrigerator and microwave table chairs and in great condition but she needs to watch how she talks to her guests especially when they are just polite and just letting them know very rude but the room was ok and i travel a lot|0
i only give it 2 stars because of the wait staff the food gets 45 stars the burgers fries homemade ranch and sweet tea are great the country style steak on wednesdays is also very good but the waitresses at night and on the weekends are terrible they are not attentive to their customers at all you have to flag them down and ask for drink refills to go boxes or anything else you need that is if they will ever look at you so you can get their attention it is ridiculous they need to find new wait staff who are attentive and friendly they do not act like they care about the customers or of the get a good tip again food is really good but night and weekend wait staff are just plain horrible|0
i have given this place 3 chances and it still disappoints me the food is subpar the ambiance is terrible and the servers are rude i was there a few weeks back and my friends and i after a night out were reminiscing and our waitress was the biggest snob listening into our conversation and giving her opinion she was rude enough to the point we almost walked out before our food after a 45 minute wait was even served this place wont last long in old town with mediocre food at best slow service and rude employees there are too many other great spots in old town people will venture to|0

worst stylist i have ever encountered ever i went to this shop two months ago for a touch up the touch up it self wasnt bad but she doesnt work the hair i had to request that she goes through the hair one more time she does not believe in basing the scalp or front edges to prevent burns she said the chemicals in modern perms are made to prevent burns which is bullshit i came with my hair pre based from home but i still burned in my temple region the styling part was no styling at all very disappointed after she blew dried my hair she supposedly flat ironed it i said supposedly because there was no evidence or inkling of my hair ever being flat ironed she put no type of grease to make it silky i still had dry puffy hair with no bumps or shape of any kind i complained and asked for hair grease she said it didnt need it and that my hair already had enough oil from the perm and the base prior to the perm makes no damn sense especially when the hair has been washed she said she didnt like grease what so ever and i should not use them either unless it is oil you can eat whatever happens to doing what your customer want she pissed me off further by blaming the layers in my hair from a previous cut for her lack of skills she had the nerve to offer to add more layers as a solution to the problem instead of curling it i went home styled it all over again and went back an hour later to show her that she was wrong she was like oh ok it looks a little better ill put grease for you next time no thanks 55 was way too much for what i got|0

dont bother wasting your money their website claims their banners will last 35 years yet ive only owned my 300 feather banners for 5 months and already the hole has poked through the top of the fabric the feather flag came down because the pole poked through and now the pole is broken two and pieces are missing these fabric banners need to be reinforced at the top to prevent this from happening the breakage of these banners is a direct result of poor quality workmanship i called for a replacement and spoke to the service manager sam freeman he offered me 10 off a new set of banners and refused to replace them under warranty because it expires after 120 days thats not what the far section of the website states so ive owned my banners 4 months the warranty expired last month now my banners are trash huge waste of 300 and very poor customer service|0

two weeks ago i was pulling a late night in the office and was getting hungry needing something extremely close to pick up that didnt require a trip in the car i called of changs and ordered the ginger chicken with broccoli for pickup when i could sneak out of the office to walk over the phone call went ok but could have done without the three separate attempts to up sell me appetizers or another entree after picking up the food and bringing it back to the office the quality of the food was clearly not much better than the freezer isle the rice was greasy and the chicken was bland the sauce was the only saving grace to the whole meal but could have done without so much sugar 1 star for having high quality take out containers that i can reuse as tupperware in the office but in the end i will gladly go elsewhere versus low quality chinese take out at twice the price|0

as a frequent business traveler and an avis preferred plus member i have come to expect a certain level of service from avis this location is a disaster the building and lot configuration could use a major overhaul the manager and staff could all use a lesson or two in customer service your e going to have to wait im busy could probably be rephrased when speaking to loyal customers my last rental i was forced to wait an extra thirty minutes while they finished cleaning the car i had reserved once i entered the vehicle it smelled of smoke i notified the manager and her solution was ive got some orange spray if your e stuck dealing with avis like i am find another location|0

i would like to update my previous review on dagger music about a week or so ago kelly texted me and apologized for not getting back with me on the issue i was having she made an appointment and came out again to the house to see what could be done she spent an hour taking the piano apart and going through all the keys and trying to adjust anything that might have caused the keys to stick she told me to let her know if it worked she didnt charge to come back out and was very nice about it|1

the steel creek athletic association sca has been an outstanding environment for both of my sons soccer flag football tackle football baseball they have leagues for all while the kids practice you can walk or run around the facility 1 mile completely around the park the only minor knock on the facilities is the limited bathrooms dependence on porta potties however the people and the parents weve encountered at steele creek are all top notch and know what family community is about this is a great association for families we really lucked up by moving to this area of charlotte|1
we choose to stay here because it had a continental breakfast a perk over a few other hotels that didnt the rooms are decent a typical hotel room with a to that was a little too small bathroom sink drained super slow so that was annoying but other than that whatever it provided a bed but between the crappy halfas continental breakfast and the shitty parking no literally the underground parking is basically covered in pigeon feathers and shit i wouldnt stay here again i may have picked up bird flu from the parking lol|0
i gave atlas audio repair my fender tube amp when it started giving me trouble on tour i paid the 40 evaluation deposit and asked to speak with the technician the man at the counter said he was busy and would pass on any information to the amp tech i said that would be fine but we agreed that before any work was done to the amp the tech would give me a phone call to discuss the work and estimate three hours later i received a phone call notifying me that the amp had been repaired a speaker cable had come loose the friendly amp tech said and he had simply re soldered it when i asked how much it would cost he said he didnt handle the money side of things and handed me to the man back at the desk he wanted 170 and when i expressed my surprise at the fee he exploded in a rage saying i could come by and pick it up after they had undone their work a few minutes later i got a call from the owner who began the conversation calmly but soon exploded in his own right calling me a prick when i mentioned our prior agreement that i would have to agree to any work beforehand he admitted that we had had the conversation but said that i didnt understand electronics and began ranting about his years of experience finally he told me to come by in an hour because it would take that long to undo the repair fearing that he might sabotage my amp i swung by with the band right away and got my amp back running a soldering iron off our car battery i performed the 170 repair in a minute and a half on the city street outside of atlas we returned a screwdriver they had left in the back of the amp back in california one of the worlds finest amp techs would have charged us 2040 if atlas had held up their end of the agreement they would be in the same boat minus this shitty review do not take your electronics to this overpriced nuthouse|0

possibly one of the worst decisions i have ever made was to leave my car with pep boys every morning my car sounds like nails on a chalk board thanks to them i wish i could give zero stars i took my car to pep boys in december because they were running a promo on tires and i needed to get my tires changed before the weather turned bad while there they recommended i change my front brakes as well as they were pretty worn but the rear ones were fine for now there was no noise coming from them but after having the car for three years i figured the brakes were due for a change that was trip one i was there on sunday from 114 to get tires and brakes changed 700 a week later a coworker told me my car was squeaking extremely loud and that i should get it checked out i took it back to this location as soon as i could asked them to change my rear brakes and for them to confirm that the squeaking was gone after four hours at the shop and 200 they told me the noise was gone i literally pulled out of the parking lot and immediately heard the squeaking i took it back the following weekend complained about the squeaking they had my car for another three hours told me they made some adjustments and the squeaking was gone again as soon as i pulled out of the lot i could hear the noise was not gone i had no way of knowing whether they actually even touched my car but certainly nothing was solved and we arent talking about a subtle squeak i am embarrassed to let coworkers in my car because of how loud it is there is no way they drove the car around and could not hear it the following week i decided that if the guys at this pep boys werent going to do anything about it i would take it to another location i took it to a neighboring pep boys explained the situation and they said they would take a look about a half hour later they came back to me and told me there is nothing they can do as i had the cheapest brake pads installed that pep boys stocks while i didnt want to take it out on that young gentleman i was livid he told me there was nothing i could do and i was stuck with the squealing again you could hear it very loudly when you are within 100 feet of my car as many of my friends have told me for the next 15000 miles fantastic to sum up ive never had any problems with my car gave it to pep boys paid 900 made four separate trips for the same issue and now my car sounds like nails on a chalk board to an extent where i cant let coworkers or clients in my car and no one seems interested in apologizing or taking responsibility not to mention that it appears they have never heard of up selling customers to better products i certainly have no plans of ever taking my car back to pep boys especially being that i havent received so much as an apology for my frustration that was caused by pep boys i certainly would not recommend this location to anyone i thought a brake pad change was routine and i could save a few bucks by going to pep boys instead of my dealership and at least they have the guts to admit when they screwed up and take steps to correct their mistakes i will never make that mistake again|0
so hot shot delivery said that they can not take my dresser upstairs because it weighs over 250lbs however they knew the weight and accepted the job from the base exchange i am sure they say they support military veterans but their actions speaks louder than words i wish i could give them a negative five stars now i have to come up with more money to hire someone to take my dresser upstairs to my bedroom as i am physically unable to do so so thank you hot shot delivery for the aggravation distress wasted time and the extra money i know have to come up with to pay another company to finish the job|0

as an asian staying at the palazzo i need to get my asian food fix since this was literally on the est floor of the hotel we had to come here after a few nights of drinking vegas problems i just wanted something soupy and basic i ordered the simple spam eggs with instant noodle i would give it a 354 out of 5 it was sooo simple that i can make at home but it just tasted like home the other items looked pretty yummy too but the pricing is what got us they have a lot of options so do check them out if you are staying in this hotel and dont want to uber somewhere else just come here its not a bad restaurant the congee size was pretty big too my friend couldnt finish it i give it more of a 35 then a 4 not so bad as it seems|1
i was thoroughly unimpressed with this venue for many reasons 1 it took 25 minutes to obtain a tasty beverage beer and about as long for glasses of water the restaurant was not even 25 full 2 the waiter strolled by with his faux hawk to take our order about 45 minutes later 3 when the food finally came a member of our party found something mysterious in her burger 4 we displayed mysterious item mentioned in 3 to said faux hawk and he appropriately took the plate away however did not omit the vulgar item from the bill until we explicitly asked bottom line the grilled salad i had was good but not good enough to warrant a second trip to cook i jacks or a recommendation to anyone|0
had the dublin burger those arent steak fries those are french fries it said ranch and biq were on the burger guess by a tiny little drop of each there technically was tried the irish onion soup that wasnt a crouton it was a soaked piece of bread the wings on the other hand were really good although 1049 for 8 wings is a bit out of control now i know why they never said how many there is on the menu mandarin ginger chicken salad was also pretty tasty but ive had side salads bigger than is and at 1149 is a total rip off also didnt help that during a dinner rush they had two servers and a full dining room guess you can add understaffed to overpriced and not that great tasting|0
i got this brand new straw hat in a garage sale its soft big and well made with real straw i paid 200 for its quality i decided to google and locate the store and i definitely will visit the store when i am vegas or on cruise for 10 you can not go wrong for too much|1
im not sure who owns this car wash these days it seems to have changed hands and has completely gone downhill i have had two ridiculously bad car washes in a row and wont go back for a third today i got the gold wash for 20 i waited over 40 mins for my car to be done way too long but if they do a good job i can understand the extra time not the case at all they didnt wipe down any of the interior not the dash not the seats nothing i was out there cleaning it myself after also they did a half assed job on vacuuming i had to vacuum again when i got home all of this kind of defeats the purpose of paying to have my car washed dont you think garbage service|0
we had our pool resurfaced with pebbles cape replaced the tile tested the plumbing replaced in floor heads installed salt system etc the beginning of the renovation went well before they had all of our money and afterwards i had to call to get them to come back and show me how to use the system and also a reminder to set up the saltwater system then they sent josh out to install a new leveller and we ended up with a flood in the corner which my husband dug up guess where the water was coming from yes the bottom pipe by the leveller after quite a few phone calls and them not even coming to see the problem they sent their plumber who just looked and walked away i told the owner that and he said he is a great plumber been in the business for 17 years like a do that can just look at a patient and diagnose really is all i can say unbelievable long story short the owner supposedly talked to his friend who is the engineer behind the part and said it was impossible that it cracked the line note his friend i called the company that manufactures the part a a who were very kind and helpful who told me that they could not guarantee that it wouldnt crack a pipe without even coming out to look at the problem they were denying responsibility then the owner of the company said his family member i believe he said his name is andy garcia a lawyer could settle this i would never ever ever deal with this company really sad the sales person joe was fantastic considering the fix on this would be may be 100 hard to believe they wouldnt just come and fix it after doing a massive renovation inside and outside of our house id have to say this was by far our worst experience|0
i was so impressed the gentleman was so kind my refrigerator in my rental house was not working properly and he said to call the company direct because he thought it would still be under warranty he didnt charge me a fee at all this is a man you can trust thank you nicolas|1

this is two reviews in one cleaning 5 stars zoom whitening 1 stars and unfortunately thats the one that has to be seen general comments very friendly staff and very punctual both times i was seen a couple minutes before my appointment time since i arrived early very punctual despite burning my gums with their mistake during the whitening i never received even an apology i get it that you dont want to take blame but the only way that you could have burned my gums is if you chose to apply the bleaching agent directly to my gums instead of the protective barrier liquid anyway i bought a group on for a cleaning and zoom whitening the dentist who saw me was do for ough i and i believe the hygienists name was steph i have such a bad memory my old dentist was wonderful but at atrium they seem to have more of the latest and greatest gadgets better xray machines better tooth cleaning tools etc they used a couple i had never seen before some ultrasonic water thingy rather than the usual scrape scrape scraping and a laser cavity detector both the dentist and the hygienist were very kind and explained everything to me the hygienist said that she usually works with kids and i can definitely see that she has a calming personality and she made sure to tell me exactly what she was doing each step of the way ive been fortunate enough to have never had a bad experience with a dentist but for anyone whos afraid she seems like shed be able to calm them down the only negative is that the cleaning took a bit longer than i was expecting because we had to wait for one of the xray machines to free up as it was already being used in any case a 5 star experience two days later today i went in for my zoom whitening i dont know how much you know about zoom but first they apply a protective barrier to your gums so that the bleaching agent doesnt burn them and then they apply the bleaching agent with the laser light thing something went very very wrong when they put the barrier on my gums i dont know what exactly happened but rather than a protective barrier it felt like the bleaching agent had been applied directly to my gums instead it was a familiar feeling from when ive accidentally gotten the gel from my at home bleaching trays on my gums within 15 seconds it was hurting pretty bad so i had her take it off my gums are still burned several hours later as i write this and theyre swollen and white in certain spots but i anticipate it will heal soon do for ough i said it probably couldnt have been an allergic reaction based on the ingredients so i can only assume they put the bleaching agent on my gums other than that my whitening experience went well but its simply unacceptable to harm your patient during a procedure without even an apology i contacted zoom and they never got back to me either with an answer not super pleased|0
great spot to grab a drink and people watch five stars since they serve food from the vig deli next door|1
chips and salsa are fine but ive had better i often forget that their cheese quesadillas have green chiles which turn me off the service can be a bit slow however i think its because they dont have a lot of help ill give them credit for the happy hour specials and the quiet atmosphere but thats about it|0
apparently this company doesnt know how to read as i found their solicitation literature stuffed behind the no soliciting sign on my front door will make sure to never use their services thanks guild for letting me know who not to do business with|0
i like the decor of the lounge there were some aesthetically pleasing waitresses to the eye service was good but the food was bland i ordered a medium rare new york strip and what i received was a tough dry and medium well steak if not well done the twice baked potato was very tasty i would go back for drinks but definitely not for food|0
i will never bring my children here again i phoned to make an appointment for my 5 year old daughter who was having considerable tooth pain but the lady i spoke with was so ignorant i didnt even make it through the call to book her in she was very irritated that i asked for their approximate fees for an emergency check up and rays when i questioned the reason they wouldnt disclose their starting rates she hung up on me wow i wasnt a new client either just last year my oldest daughter had over 4000 of work done here and i wasnt particularly impressed with the service then either who wants to bring a young child to a pediatric dentist center when they cant even be polite and respectful to the parent i have never written a bad review on a company before but this place out of any place that i have had terrible service from deserves it the most after reading other reviews specifically on google im not alone in feeling this way they have many clients who have expressed frustration with the poor attitude of the staff|0
i use to come here all the time with my boyfriend during lunch as they had a wide variety of options and free pop refills however my most recent trip wasnt so pleasant they completely changed their lunch menu by cutting the selection right in half hardly anything good to choose from not to mention as soon as i paid for my meal and left and overly generous tip my boyfriend and i grabbed our half full pop cans to take to finish on our way home and the waitress literally ran up and blocked our way out demanding we leave our drinks excuse me i already paid that really aggravated me however a perk is that they offer sashimi for lunch which many ay ce places dont do|0
ive had a few less than ideal experiences with baum bled automotive and will have to pass on going there again the first time i bought some tires from tire rack to be installed at baum they called me when they arrived and i swung by to get the new tires installed i gave them my keys and before i left i asked if they had an idea on when my car might be done the guy seemed incredibly irritated and he said they couldnt tell me that as if it were a completely ridiculous thing to ask i didnt need to know the time down to the minute i was just trying to get an idea of when the work would be complete i dont know may be he was having a bad day but it really came across as rude ultimately the work was done fine but i came away feeling pretty crappy about my experience the second time my girlfriend took her car to get a state and emissions inspection they passed the car for emissions but wrote the wrong vin on the sticker and failed it for safety they claimed that it would require about 900 worth of work to get it to pass inspection which i was very suspicious of we took it to walters down the street and showed them the inspection notes from baum it did fail inspection at walters too but as i suspected some of the things that baum failed the car for were pretty bogus 480 in repairs from walters later the car was back in business between rude employees and obvious up selling i cant really recommend baum boulevard to anyone when there are quality places like walters and morningside auto nearby if your car needs work take it to one of those places instead|0
had the shattered screen replaced in my ipod touch these guys were great they replaced the screen while i waited and did an excellent job at a reasonable price i highly recommend them|1
ordered online through their website it was relatively quick and easy did not have to register or create an account like other take out places order thai green curry lunch special 799 tax i ordered the lunch special online on a saturday arrived at the restaurant 10 mins later and waited for mins tip 1 they really do take 30 mins to prepare your order regardless of how empty it was when i arrived i was told because it is a saturday there is no lunch special so i was forced to change my order to the full priced but larger portioned alternative 12 inc tax tip 2 even though the website allows you to order lunch specials on a weekend they will deny your order when you arrive at the restaurant loss 1 star because of this the food portions were very large similar to congee queen portions the green curry met up to the hype it was very pungent and flavorful with lots of chicken and veggies quality wise it can definitely go head to head with thai basil curries and for a cheaper price too overall i am sold and will be returning whenever i crave curry|1
quite possibly the worst service i have ever encountered here in las vegas and thats saying something use anybody else anybody|0
do stephanie chan was the best dentist i have ever been to she was kind calming and patient not only was it clear that she was technically skilled when it came to my wisdom teeth extraction her yoga es breathing and body relaxation instructions really relaxed distracted me through the process she also thoroughly explained aftercare instructions before i left i feel fortunate to have stumbled upon her and will definitely be requesting her services for future dental work|1

the finest and most pleasurable eyeglass buying experience imaginable a great selection of unique frames with expert service the range of frames was far beyond the usual suspects at costco etc the service was very personalized and friendly the expertise extends to specialized lenses for persons engaged in heavy computer usage a far better choice than optical dispensers in scottsdale named after ski resorts by the way the interior of the store is smashing for those who might underestimate what you will find on ith avenue just north of camelback|1
this company installed a new furnace and ac system for my sister she is very happy with the work that was done the price and the clean up and follow up after the system was installed she is very pleased with the cold air blowing out of the ac this summer its been very hot lets hope the winter isnt too cold but if it is im sure the new furnace from vente i will keep her and her cats warm|1
terrible customer service rude employees every time ive been reminds me why i go to costco not renewing membership with sams club extremely frustrated i found a table at scottsdale store but it had a mark on it they said they had the same one at the with ave bell store if i wanted to go get it there or they i give me 10 off the marked up one called with ave store put it on hold for me i drove there stood in their always long customer service line with only one employee working behind desk taking phone calls assisting in store customers the customer service lady rings the table up its almost 100 more than the one at the scottsdale store i explained they told me at the scottsdale store that it was discounted because its a canceled item for sams club not discounted because it was last one with mark on it in fact the scottsdale store said they i take 10 off price if i wanted the marked one she offered no apologies or reasoning as to why it was more at that particular store she blamed the scottsdale store for not telling me they were different prices she was trying to rush me away from service counter usually when stores have 2 different prices on same item they give to paying customer for the lower priced one but not sams club apparently now i see why costco is always busy sams club is always slow|0
i stopped here because they had a sign out front cars 1 and my five year old loves cars we bought some little cars turned out to be 50 cents each a large lego chima figure and some other small things including a book it is very well organized and it would be great for people looking for baby and childrens clothing a nice selection of toys and games for kids we will be back the next time we come to madison|1

id like to start with saying i have never written a negative review my chicken is raw my cloths fell apart doesnt bother me as long as when i express myself to the management its fixed which it always is with gateway property management this was not the case we had 2 bikes neatly stored on our balcony i realize this is against policy but it you saw the bike storage you would understand why we tried to avoid it the bike storage is literally a sea of trashed walked over childrens bikes and bikes from the 1800s of course we were immediately sent emails and pictures slid under our door to immediately remove the bikes or we would be fined frustrated we moved the bikes into the far back corner of the bike storage to avoid any damage locked both of them up very securely not even a week later stolen not trashed along with the rest of the unlocked bikes just gone of course we immediately tried calling management both the assistant manager and manager left messages with both not an email text or call back been quite some time now for a company that cant seem to keep the walk paths shovelled as well as the 711 across the road this is pretty embarrassing especially with how quickly they where to send threats of fines i will strongly avoid any apartments i rent or purchase in the future if managed by gateway|0
this is the government at its best do not expect common sense customer service or to see anyone working you have to be a a special kind of stupid to work here they suck they actually suggested we drive out to boulder city for passport assistance instead of doing their job and taking care of their customer call the number to schedule an appointment and the line is busy and there isnt anyone in the post office go figure|0
this was my and time here in as many weeks and both times were spectacular from the very attentive service the great is music playing on my and visit to the really delicious food this is certainly worth visiting again the atmosphere is cozy with a large bar which takes up most of the room and some kitschy red tomato lamp shades along the bar area there are very comfortable chairs and booth areas along the walls as well on my first visit i was invited to try out their new pizza menu there is a wide variety of choices with very unique flavors and toppings all on nicely crispy thin crusts from the reds i thoroughly enjoyed the sausage pizza which came with tomato caramelized onions and fennel just enough kick in the sausage to be enjoyable another red which was interesting was the hangover cure although a bit salty for my taste it certainly was a taste treat with tomato bacon olives chilies and sop press at a from the whites there was also quite a bit of choice with a mushroom pizza a smoked salmon which ended up being my favorite and a potato pizza the mushroom pizza consisted of a variety of 4 types of mushrooms with truffle oil drizzled on top quite tasty if you like the different textures and flavors of mushrooms as i do the potato pizza had yukon gold potato of course along with caramelized onions and thinly sliced fennel which gave it a lovely flavor my favorite as mentioned above was the smoked salmon pizza a thin crust with mascarpone spread grana padano thinly sliced apple and arugula the arugula gave a very nice peppery taste along with the creaminess of the mascarpone there are also some very interesting marriages of ingredients with the peking duck pizza and the smoked chicken with chipotle biq sauce the peking duck pizza was very flavorful with the crispy duck crackling but i found the hoisin sauce drizzle too sweet for my liking the smoked chicken was very interesting with the tiny bit of spice with the addition of the chipotle biq sauce all of the pizzas are reasonably priced from 1500 to 1800 each for 4 large slices on my and visit i was lucky enough to share in a sampling of several appetizers some mains as well as 3 of their desserts our group shared 2 soups the baked lobster and crab soup and the gumbo sausage and chicken i corn bread both soups were very rich and the melding of flavors made them delicious the gumbo had tasty corn bread to sop up even the last drop where the lobster and crab had what looked like beautifully toasted bun on the top again to sop up every last delicious drop we also shared the jerk wings the calamari and the coconut shrimp all 3 were tasty but nothing out of the ordinary we decided to try some of the pastas and share them as well the favorite by far was the garlic shrimp i angel hair pasta plump shrimp and the past melted in our mouths we also tried the mushroom arnold tit i mushroom truffle butter sauce i was partial to this as i loved the mushroom flavors with the truffle butter sauce another favorite was the meatball gnocchi with marinara sauce i sausage and angus beef meatballs nice flavors in the meatballs and the gnocchi were nicely done and held on to the marinara beautifully one can not have a lovely meal such as this and ignore dessert we decided to share again with bread pudding i chocolate and banana chocolate mouse and our waiters favorite creme brulee all 3 were tasty with their own unique flavors but i agree with our waiter and will vote for the creme brulee as my fave although i have tried almost everything on the menu i will most certainly go back as some things are worth repeating|1
absolute terrible place to work and eat they treat employees terrible they work you to death and take money out your paycheck if you do something like drop bread its micro managed to hell and back every single penny counts with with them im pretty sure the employee that replaced me had a heroin overdose on the job and the ambulance had to arrive|0
came to get my car washed and was greeted by a man who made it clear that he didnt want us here i asked for a package that included a vacuum he began telling me that he will gladly run the car through the automated wash but did not want to do the vacuuming he claimed that it would back him guy up when we insisted that we didnt mind the wait for the vacuum he annoyingly grabbed our money and turned his back on us we were stuck inside the automated washer with no assistance its convenient for me to come here but after this incident i would rather drive elsewhere|0
i love this place great food great atmosphere and good prices for the incredible view of the strip all the shrimp dishes are delish try either the beef or pork with coca cola sauce if you are coke fan parking is a pain during prime hours but that is only because this place is so popular you will always eventually find a parking spot there just might be a little bit of walk to the restaurant once you get inside you will realize it was worth the distractions|1
updated since they did finally give our money back still beware|0

streetside classics totally misrepresented the true condition of this car it looked great but mechanically it was a piece of junk i was shocked and appalled when it was delivered and you will be too when you read the details below the bottom line is that some of this companys sales persons be have like unprincipled and unscrupulous shyster i and seem only interested in making money through unethical practices customer satisfaction is not even in their vocabulary the following statements appear on the streetside classics website 1 streetside experts will evaluate your vehicle alongside current market conditions and trends and 2 the vehicle is inspected for quality and accurate representation by streetside staff and even though a streetside sales representatives later admitted to me that everyone knew this car had some severe issues they still placed a glowing and false advertisement on their website as contained in the attachment below if this is not gross misrepresentation and dishonesty i do not know what is unfortunately i had to buy the car sight unseen and i stupidly believed them when they assured me that it was in great condition the only thing wrong they said at first was that the turn signal light did not work on the dashboard and the horn did not work what a pack of lies they later admitted that it needed a new frame but only after a third party identified this problem and i did negotiate a 10000 reduction in price to take care of the cost of the frame replacement alas as you can see in the attachment that frame turned out to be only the tip of the iceberg and i have had to spend an additional 26000 to make the car safe to drive i gave them every opportunity to take the high road and help with the 26000 worth of additional repairs this car needed but they adamantly refused saying that i agreed to buy it as is of course that agreement was based on a bed of lies and a total misrepresentation of the facts and would never stand up in court see the link below for details please visit our website wow streetside classics beware com|0

this place is amazing what a hidden gem its honestly my new favorite restaurant in gilbert i almost dont want to write this review because then the secret will be out my husband and i came on a recent saturday evening and were surprised that they still do happy hour on saturdays we were able to enjoy discounted wine and 6 apps yay the food was delicious we enjoyed the bruschetta board here much more than another gilbert restaurants bruschetta board you know who im talking about they also had a two man band playing some light classic rock hits they were awesome it wasnt too loud and my husband and i could still carry on a conversation without having to yell over the band service was excellent our server was there when we needed him and not overbearing very friendly and prompt i have absolutely nothing bad to say about this place love it cant wait to return|1
i went to the castle shannon store and spent 800 on a new snowboard hardware and gear the next weekend i went up 7 springs and spent 200 on gloves and pants after leaving the store i went to use the pants and they didnt fit well and i couldnt even zip them up the weekend after that i went to the monroeville store with a receipt of purchase to exchange the pants for another pair that fit better and i was denied i called the manager in castle shannon as directed by the monroeville manager and over the phone i was told that they would not exchange all because i tried them on without use and thats considered use 1000 spent in two weeks at their stores and they couldnt do a simple exchange on a pair of pants me nor anybody i know will ever step foot in one of their stores again everything is cheaper online but you would think that somebody local would give you better customer service so oooo disappointed|0

i looked up of in wikipedia they claim they have been in business since 1871 wiki tells me that no they only bought a grocery chain that had been is business since then theyve also bought a lot of other small chains one of which was called smart final named for the owners and for some odd reason they decided they would use that bizarre name anyway finally went to this one yesterday and it didnt work out well store looks ok from the outside though a little shabby but the inside makes it clear that the building is from the is or is rundown crappy looking they had advertised became beer 30 packs for 1699 two limit i got there and they only had one 30 pack i asked a kid who worked there if there were any more he said no but that they should have some in a day or two i walked around the rest of their warehouse for a while wasnt impressed with their prices or anything else i started thinking that the only reason that they call their business a warehouse is so that they can buy crappy old buildings and convince people its ok because theyre a warehouse i dont know though just my opinion stood in line trying to checkout only one checker i finally asked her if she could call another checker manager showed up about then and started checking though i noticed that he was at a closed check stand after a minute doing something there for about five minutes so his arrival didnt help the problem i had stayed in the same line so finally got up there got checked out about a block away i thought to glance at my receipt i saw that the checker had charged me full buck for the beer turned around went back to the store couple minutes to find the manager he said the reason for that is you have to buy two of them to get the price i had forgotten that part i told him but there was only one available he said there were other beers available you could have bought one of them i told him i dont drink bud so i went back to the car got the became went back into the store stood in line again got my refund thanked the manager for wasting a half hour of my life and left never to return i decided that they are not smart but they are final since thats the final time i will ever darken their door|0

we were hopeful that this organization would be able to help with some simple obedience training for our greyhounds sadly they had done zero research and showed up with an insistence to use a choker chain i know when used properly they can be a good training aid however with a greyhounds sensitive neck it did not seem necessary our male greyhound bared his teeth at the trainer which he said was normal that was our free lesson on my own i had both of our hounds able to sit down and stay using just our farthingale collar and a little patience within one week please be certain they have learned about your breed before buying a package|0

i never write bad reviews but i was so upset after leaving this place i called in before i came in to check on pricing on alterations and the girl told me 67 over the phone and so i was reluctant to bring my pants in right away when i came to pick them up they told me it was double that for each pair it would have been one thing to understand that the customer was obviously misinformed be i was surprised on the price and even explained to them what i was told by the other employee but they had poor customer service by automatically telling me the manager would still make me pay before even trying anything and that i wouldnt be able to find alterations for 67 anywhere but its not like i arbitrary picked 67 out of no where to get a cheap hem this is what i was informed then they call the employee who misinformed me to make sure even though i already got the impression they werent gonna do anything about it and the employee says she doesnt remember so of course its her word against mine therefore they told me they can take the hem out or give me a 10 discount how generous of them|0

wanted to like this place i love supporting small local businesses parking was easy behind the shop i found the setup a bit odd and the non cupcake things on the walls made it feel a little bit garage sale like we stopped in midafternoon on a saturday and the selection was limited by that time of day we bought a pack of the french toast cupcakes and i have to say were disappointed the cupcakes were on the dry side and the frosting was just average the bacon on top was amazing but when isnt bacon amazing once was enough for us the two remaining cupcakes are still sitting on my counter almost a day later|0
front desk not knowledgeable maintenance staff has no clue how to properly make repairs on many issues manager knowingly hides significant and dangerous problems with residences when selling as is contracts which is illegal even when selling as is it must be safely habitable they have meters for each lot yet charge a flat fee anyway regardless of water usage their contracts are so full of binding word age that you will never be allowed to make repairs to your residence so most residences are falling apart in the park even when the residents want to make repairs and keep their place looking good do not trust these people you will regret it|0

i think this place is great after calling around for different prices at different places tire craft had the best prices and on top of that the manager suggested some tires for my car and they are excellent nice to drive on when i first went to get my new tires put on they told me it would take about an hour it actually took quite a bit longer than that because they for some reason ordered the wrong size for my car i thought that was strange since i gave him the exact reading for my car but anyway after it was all done and i went to pay it turned out to be less than he quoted me on the phone may be that was because i had to wait extra long in addition to that because i bought my tires there i get free tire rotations when i need to get my winter tires put on and then back to all seasons plus free tire repairs if i get a hole or a leak in one of my tires i was quite happy with that recently i needed basic maintenance on my car so i took it there for a belt change and air filter change they did the job for a reasonable price it did take longer than it should have because for some reason again they ordered the wrong belt for my car they had to drive to the other side of town to get the right one good thing i live in walking distance so i waited in the comfort of my home since my first visit having to wait there so long i now just drop my car off and leave right away and either walk to chinook mall or home which is better cause i usually have time to bake cookies or something while i wait haha for that reason living so close makes it very convenient and i like that theyre are open on saturday i think its better if you call before you go there and get quotes and such instead of just doing a walk in or should i say drive in ive been happy with my service at tire craft despite the occasional longer wait time|1

horrible my friend ordered a burrito and i ordered a burrito bowl we were told that they were out of the veggies a bit disappointing but we wanted to try anyways the person at the counter was extremely cheap and light with toppings considering they were out of veggies i wanted more lettuce in my bowl you choose between rice or lettuce for the bowl and i didnt want any rice so after she put a handful of lettuce i asked for more she then selected two leaves of lettuce to put on my bowl and quickly moved on how can one be cheap with lettuce its lettuce considering i am not getting the tortilla or any veggies you think one would want to make me happy and give me more lettuce i would have even payed for double lettuce if this option was available to me instead i am left feeling like i am begging for more toppings when really i want a real salad and prefer lots of lettuce also my friends burrito was cold the chicken is really dry i was not happy with my salad either and overall this was a horrible experience for a new addition to my neighborhood companies need to realize that the majority of fast casual restaurants are giving customers choice to customize with tons of value has tac cori to seen the humongous salads burrito boyz is giving and if you want more lettuce they give you freaking lettuce my point is its lettuce never again bye|0

i purchased a home in quintessa mountains edge from this builder in july 2017 they didnt start building till 1017 then it was a mad rush to finish by year end i was told on 1226 it was complete hardly it true when they say the little things go a long ways no warranty paperwork left for any appliances microwave crooked ended up being kitchen shelves crooked dishwasher didnt work patched holes were not textured or painted power outlets didnt work in mater bath closet light switch didnt work in extra bedroom several paint touch ups needed to be done that were pointed out in the walk through were never done i spent at least three saturdays waiting around in an empty house for these things to be fixed and then when they could not come on saturdays i had to take off work to sit and wait around for the four hour time window customer service was never much help all she could do was say sorry after the wiring was fixed it was drywall patching again to which i had to paint myself after begging for four weeks to get my touch up paint kit so after moving in i had to spend 60 of my own money on paint because the touch up kit took so long my front steps needed to be repainted due to some kind of discoloring from the builder i had to ask for this to be done apparently it was not common sense from the numerous times they builders team was in out my front door the day i decided all things had been complete i asked for my key back and was told i would have to be available between their working hours of 74pm to get my key back you would think after the weeks of headaches they would service an upset home owner and come to me at 430 when i would be home yet again i do have a job then in the midst of all that i was never given the garage door clickers and the gate clicker didnt work either tracking all these things down on my own time was not fun moving is not fun instead of these things being just common courtesy by the builder turned into a babysitting job of contractors|0

at first i was impressed but when the actual driving started i was immediately disappointed the instructor jay was disorganized and constantly cancelled lessons at the end of every lesson he would let me know how many of the lessons i had finished and the number was suspiciously high sometimes to the point where i had to correct him i eventually lost track and depended on him which was a mistake in order to book an appointment for my go road test i had to have completed the driving portion of the course 10hrs so i signed the paper when he told me to so i could get my licence a little sooner he then asked if i wanted a lesson before my test which i thought was complimentary because at this point i knew i hadnt finished all 10 lessons well it wasnt i was charged 30 for a lesson with a completely different instructor in a completely different car because he was busy with another client yes i made a stupid mistake signing that paper but overall i would say this is a dishonest business|0

dec 14 2015 avoid absolutely i ordered 3 shirts and 1 sweeter and paid by visa on nov 6 2015 shortly after i got a call that the order was sent to the wrong customer and the problem was to be taken care of without delay well the first week of december i still hadnt received so i sent an email with no response the second week of december i called and was told 2 items that i ordered were on back order and that they were waiting to receive these items before they shipped my order i asked how long this would take and they could i answer i then asked for the order to be canceled and my visa credited for the charges this was a thursday and they appologise i and said the credit will go through today friday afternoon i checked and no credit i called again and this time i got the owner he proceeded to make up some justifications out of thin air and i cut him off he didnt like this and proceeded to tell me i needed to be civil in the end he gave me his word that before the day was done on friday my card would be credited well today is monday and still no credit so if you want hassle free purchasing i would suggest looking for someone other than just white shirts no were did this store try to please me the customer i am done|0

i would stay away this was the worst mexican food experience i have ever had including taco bell and other fast food service was painfully slow even getting seated or water and chips chips were bland and salsa even i lander the burrito fajita came after a 20 minute wait and was disgusting no other word for it it was drenched with sour cream soggy from the grease and the ingredients tasted as if they were from a local school cafeteria i couldnt finish more than one bite the server stopped by after another 10 minutes and i asked for my check no concern for the quality of my meal or even a thought for my experience eat at taqueria guadalajara on park it instead|0
i called this company to get price quotes for a relative i had service with locksmith in the past i didnt remeber if this was the company i had service before i was trying to explain my self to the guy he said end with bullshit whats my name and i did tell him my name and i said sir why are you talking to me like that he start calling me a piece of shit|0

first time in the store i went to inquire about a custom logo being engraved onto 2 champagne glasses there were 2 customers ahead of me speaking to the one girl who was running the registers i had to wait for 10 minutes before anyone even acknowledged me finally when i got to speak to her i showed her the design and she immediately told me no without any explanation i asked a few questions as to why was the glass too narrow do they not engrave items not purchased there no answer she just kept saying no the best part is their website clearly says that custom business logos can be engraved via digitizing the image thanks for nothing things remembered|0
really great pizza their staff came through in a pinch and baked a dozen pies for the crew we had working a train derailment in mckeesport 20 plus hungry men had nothing but compliments on the quality thanks|1
if i could give this salon 0 stars i would i went to this salon because i had no other time during the week to go to my normal salon and they are open until 5 sundays the salon was dirty and i had to ask the manicurist to clean the station and change the tools when i sat down it took the manicurist 1 hour and 30 mins to do a basic gel manicure i have never had a manicure take longer than an hour the bottle of top coat was running out and the manicurist did not get a new bottle so my manicure was not smooth i was very unimpressed and will not be surprised if this place is shut down by the health department i surely will never return|0

this restaurant located insider the madison hotel toronto airport was very clean and had a vey friendly wait staff our bartender was friendly pretty and very accommodating to our requests for food and drinks she was attentive and provided quality service though we did not eat there in the morning the restaurant was packed with assuming happy patrons|1
food is ok but the portion size is horrendous paying for a large dinner and getting something that is half packed of food definitely a medium or just smaller and still feeling hungry in the end isnt worth the money would have loved a decent caribbean near mimic but dont feel like being short changed|0
please do not go here if you have a last minute emergency and your regular vet is not available or closed go to a 247 vet my dog randomly started to act differently he was severely lethargic didnt have an appetite and was breathing a little weird the only reason why we took him there was because our regular vet was not available and he needed medical attention immediately they were great with booking him in without any notice but that was only good experience a couple things 1 the do could not figure out what was wrong with our dog 2 the do recommended he have our dog for two whole days at the vet on iv looking back i am incredibly mad he was locked in a tiny crate for 12 hours on an iv he could have been home with us 3 they mislabeled some of the medication he told us to give 4 tablets every morning total of 200 my it ended up being 600 my every morning we were overdosing our dog when we confronted the do about this he tried to wiggle his way out of his mistake and said i planned on contacting you we called him he then said oh the next morning give him two tablets 4 we contacted our original vet and the do at city centre refused to fax over the documents we had to get our vet to physically call and demand the records there were so many more issues that went on between the vet and our dog i am angry and grieving and frustrated we lost our dog to leukemia our original vet took over after 25 weeks of city centre doing nothing except charge us 200000 our vet found out what was wrong with him after one day this was the worst experience i have ever had with a vet please please please do not take your animal here they truly are treated like animals not family members|0

for the past 5 years or so my best friend and loyal companion has been a huge part of my life i was there when tidal a pitbull catahoula mix was born to my then roommates unaltered dogs after literally seeing him come into the world it was love at first sight weve been pretty much inseparable since i want everyone to know that i did a lot to make sure he was a well socialized and well behaved little man he went to the park and had regular encounters with other dogs to play and get out his excess energy he is very intelligent and picked up on most the basic commands very early he is a wonderful dog who loves people so much he cant help but shower everyone with affection but around his and birthday things began to change he started growing into his large body and building up his muscular build after reaching his physical maturity he got into a scuffle with one of his siblings while playing together it was at that very moment that his mindset while being around other dogs was completely altered he no longer felt safe or comfortable with being around any other dog except his sister for the past 3 years i have struggled with his increasing aptitude for dog on dog aggression i love dogs and i will always have one in my life but tidal i aggression reached the point that many of the normal things you enjoy doing with your dog became impossible alone or with his sister he was just fine but the moment he saw any other dog it was on after a couple more scuffles and one serious incident in which he attacked a family friends dog and almost killed her i no longer let him get anywhere near other dogs i know that it was a mistake to completely shut him off from interaction with other animals but i was too afraid that something else would happen and he would have to be put down i thought that living a life without dog interaction to eliminate a chance of another violent incident was better than the alternative so tidal had very little interaction with other dogs for a long time this only made his anxiety and aggression worse we could no longer go for car rides or simple walks in the park because he would see another animal and lose it i knew he needed professional help but i was never in the position to be able to afford that thats when tidal and i were introduced to alexander i was really excited and knew this was our opportunity we began meeting with him and after the first few sessions it was apparent tidal had the basic commands down pretty well it was the aggression that really needed to be addressed after being with tidal and seeing him act out i know that he can flip from being calm to attack mode in no time at all with virtually no signs i knew it was going to be tough for him and mostly myself how could i put all those previous violent experiences out of my head i know what he is capable of it was hard tidal is very smart just like most dogs and he can feel that anxiety and fear the training with alexander helped train tidal but also myself to remain calm and in control of the situation because tidal needs it after a few more sessions it was apparent that tidal needed some more extensive training and guidance so alexander took him home to board for the next 6 weeks tidal spent every day with alexander i missed him so much but i knew he needed it about 5 weeks in i got a call from alexander who explained to me that not all dogs are trainable to the same extent and that tidal was making great progress but he was still very unpredictable and aggressive we agreed to give it a little more time and hope for the best i dont know what alexander did in that next week but the pictures and video he sent me of dogs walking over tidal bumping in to him and sleeping next to him literally brought tears to my eyes tidal has now been home for almost two months now and he is a completely different dog the training with alexander gave him the direction he needed and i the confidence and tools to keep up his work and progress even further he is much calmer and more relaxed in every aspect of his life i did not think it was possible but we share an even stronger bond than ever alexander and lorenzo i dog training gave tidal and i a second chance to enjoy all those things dogs and their forever friends should share together thank you for everything you have done for the both of us now my best friend and i can make so many more memories|1
this business closes at 1100 am on 7272018 i arrived at 1030pm i like this restaurant but the food items looked very old only a little more than half of the items were available because the employees didnt want to make any food i asked why about a third of the items were not available and the employee stated that they close in 15 minutes falsified statements i really hate falsified statements and therefore it did not make sense to make more food as they would end up throwing it all away at closing time ummm so we stop running a business because we will eventually close and do not want to any have leftovers please understand these were not recently just emptied containers of food that were sitting under the heat lamps there were no containers and no one was cleaning them either this action was completed long before i had walked up to this business which means that nearly one third of the food items were not available for anyone from at least 45 minutes conservatively before closing time it is important to note that i arrived to this business last week at approximately an hour before closing time food was not made but when i inquired the manager hurriedly made an item and instructed an employee to also make a second item i was told it would take 1520 minutes to make the food items this is because they were not at all prepared to make any of these items nor would they have bothered to make them if i an inquisitive customer hadnt said anything i waited on that occasion this business is now zero for two why bother returning fire your workers when a manager is not present your employees are throwing your business model in the trash|0
this place is a total hole in the wall but the service is amazing the wings and meatballs are delicious and its always busy with locals i would highly recommend this place to anyone who loves wing night|1
i called in august to reserve a 15 passenger van for a weekend in october for a bachelorette party when i called the week of the party to verify pick up and cost they told me i did not have a reservation they had my name phone number and credit card but no reservation why would they have my financial info if i didnt have a van if you have anything important going on that you actually want to attend i would think twice before using this company|0
childhood memories cant really go wrong with flavor wise with an ice cream shop that has lasted so many years still capable of keeping their flavors tasting the same at least from however young ago i remeber just made a quick stop to grab a cake for a coworker that was leaving us it was convenient to be able to just open up the freezer pick out a ready to go ice cream cake got an oreo cookie ice cream chocolate cake log shaped cake with chocolate glazed over with cherries on top it was 2299 which wasnt too bad in my opinion for the size the worker was super sweet asked if i wanted something written on it but i just didnt have time only bad thing was that it was very stuffy hot feeling in there you would think to keep the inside cool on a hot day but who knows may be the ac broke|1
i have been here multiple times and usually love it here however last night i had family in from out of town and we stopped by the pizza kitchen after being told the nicer restaurants around the mall had over 2 hour waits we were told the wait at the pizza kitchen was only 20 minutes and decided to add our name to the list we came back 20 minutes later and were told it would be an additional 20 minutes because the current table they picked for us was still seated not a problem we browsed another store and came back to be told the table was still occupied we decided to have a seat and since the small waiting area was full the hostess told us if we sat right outside they would come call us when it was ready after waiting a full hour from our original check in we went back for the ith time and the hostess told us our name was called and when no one claimed the table they sat another party we immediately asked why no one ever came to call us in the seating area and they simply said we usually recommend someone waits inside the restaurant no apology no further accommodations needless to say we left and waited for the buzzer from maggianos to go off and had a much more enjoyable experience i hope this was just a service fluke and not an every day thing but it will make me think twice before returning|0
i came across ca wax studio via google i decided to call and make an appointment to have a brazilian wax done for the first time i spoke with candice and we scheduled my appointment for the next day which was a saturday she asked if i knew where the studio was located i replied no but would google it and use the gas she assured me if i got lost it was fine to call saturday arrives and i am on my way i get to the area 15 mins in advance i can not locate the studio so i decide to call i called her three times and she did not pick up her phone i left a voice mail as well i pulled over and waited for a couple of minutes after that i decided to head back home i was pissed off as i just had the same experience with a different shop not answering i gas the route back home which was about 25 mins away and 10 mins into me being back home candice calls me a couple of times i decided not to answer as i am pissed off the studio is in a very busy area and i felt she should of picked up the phone i am always prompt on time if not early i expect a place of business to operate the same way i will not be returning nor scheduling with her again xo|0

i have been working out at this disgusting shit hole since the day it opened ive really been lucky and been able to always rejoin in the 99 program which i think reflects what the gym is actually worth now in august 2014 i allowed my membership to lapse because i had surgery and was unable to workout which i communicated with an employee of the gym to make a note on my account apparently they didnt do that when i went back in to rejoin basically when i was cleared by my doctor to work out again the general manager rebecca told me now the cost would be 200 i looked around in the gym and the same equipment was broken there was no new equipment added and it still smelled and it was still visibly dirty so i asked her what constitutes 100 more dollars for a gym membership she basically stated that there wasnt any specials going on right now and that was just the price i dont understand why asking to pay up front for the entire year is not only unacceptable but also penalized also for that matter why would they try to alienate somebody thats been working out there for almost 10 years i felt like they were just being sneaky to get into my bank account so they could do something shady which ive also experienced before thank you rebecca and planet fitness for communicating to me that my business is not welcome and im more than happy to find somewhere else to workout that isnt a disgusting shit hole|0
i love fantasia every time ive gone there i felt at peace ive always been asked if i needed assistance and yet no one ever hovering they have a wide array of items and good prices many times in these types of shops that mark up is outrageous the pricing is very fair for a retail shop the crystals and stones have beautiful energy and lovely specimens they look to be handpicked and not dead like in some places its important for me to be centered in this type of shop so i can tune into the items and i always feel that way i travel to specifically go to fantasia|1
i use to love this place not after tonight i order tonight for car take out it no go so well they tell me 20 minutes it take 60 they put hot meat sushi next to cold veggie roll it cause steam that make veg sushi nasty it sit for 20 minute while i wait for tempura i am vegetarian wasabi and ginger coated in fish my roll taste like meat they yell at me to sit down when i wait for take out looking at our rolls worst car picnic with boyfriend ever have we order 30 of food only provide one set of chopsticks tiny container of soy sauce sushi rolls were steam for 20 minutes taste disgusting do no go here|0

my family stayed at the two bedroom fully furnished and renovated penthouse apartment at chateau lincoln montreal for the entire months of august and september 2014 the building is conveniently located near many restaurants shops and grocery stores bus stops public bicycles metro station is only two blocks away the neighborhood is a bit run down but it is safe the building is kept clean and all four elevators were kept in good working conditions there is a security person at the front desk from 6 am to 6 am the access to the building is through a secure digital key and the guests can be let in through the front digital entry system and the security cameras are everywhere inside the apartment was very clean everything was new the kitchen is adequately equipped the only thing that was missing is an automatic dishwasher which my family is so used to the bedrooms were clean and of good size with enough closet and drawer space the sheets were clean but the mattresses are too soft everyone in my family likes firm mattresses and this was not very much to our liking there is only one bathroom in the two bedroom for us coming from the us this was a bit of surprise but we got used to it after a few days being on the with floor the view from our balcony was panoramic and very good especially that we could see mount royal in front of us from sunrise to sunset overall we were happy with our stay and the management and staff were very courteous and friendly we would recommend the renovated furnished apartments for short stay in montreal especially if you are looking for something that is clean and reasonably priced|1

i had my taxes prepped by brianna i aimer at beckett tax and i was very satisfied at first i was a little bit wary when i arrived because the whole operation was setup in an open office space no reception desk no comfy waiting room no complimentary coffee despite the lackluster surroundings the pas at beckett seemed very professional and down to earth the were very thorough with their analysis of my tax returns and offered me some suggestions for 2012 upon completion of my taxes i was assured that if the irs had any questions or wanted to do an audit that their organization would defend me free of cost with no added insurance fee required the final cost for preparation was probably a 15 the cost of the my pervious prepared making beckett super competitive i am 100 positive that ill be using their services next year|1
i have never used nicks but this is my experience by asking simple questions i asked about complete rebuild of my dress shoes new soles heels cork and welt etc i also asked for or soles so the shop has never heard of or soles they are the preferred brand for premium mens shoes when i asked if they would replace the cork welt etc i was met by silence they had no clue about what i was asking my friend used them for a rebuild the stitching on the sole was not inside of a groove i would not use this place to rebuild mens dress shoes|0
great store for scrubs they have so many colors styles and brands they also have a small selection of shoes and we found the white nursing shoes that are so comfortable there it was great being able to try them on to see if we really like the fit of both scrubs and shoes they also have sale racks in the back for some great savings thanks for your help yesterday|1

i had my 60000 mile check up and my oil change they pointed out a couple of other immediate needs but what i really appreciated were their explanations it made it easy to make a decision about the next steps needed to care for my car they educate you about your vehicle and the process of maintenance they give you choices and are creative with their solutions if one has budgetary limitations from what i researched on line their prices seem comparable to the going rate vehicle toyota camry service date 10232017 review created 10242017 0258 am|1
horrible service the attendants look like theyre bored are doing you a favor by helping we showed up there last night to get gas and i headed in to purchase some hand sanitizer and coffee i did a cursory look around and finding that there wasnt any in their first aid utilities section asked the attendant he sneered at me and said what sanitizer like for you i said yes and he still looked at me in disbelief i quickly realized that he thought i was asking for some from perhaps his personal bottle and politely corrected him he then said i dont know its a 500 so it store how do you not know the other attendant was slightly more helpful saying there was some behind the counter for sale the other attendant then said yeah theres some right here as if i should have looked behind the counter on the floor at a small bucket that had a few the bucket was labeled 099 but they rang it up as 380 i mentioned that it said 099 but they insisted it was 380 for a personal sanitizer tube i didnt want to go else where that night to get some so i was pretty resigned at that point to overpaying i asked them to hold on for a second and went to grab a coffee from the fridge nearest to the counter the attendant then yelled yo bro what you gonna buy this or not incredulous i looked back and replied again politely that i mentioned hold on as i was just getting a coffee they both looked at each other annoyed and then she mentioned that she thought i was going to leave again this is a 500 so it store i had moved 55 it where would i be going i hadnt made my purchase i quickly paid and filled up and left if it werent so close i wouldnt have come here i will probably suck it up and go to a different station before returning home or wait until im further away at another station will not be returning|0
infinite air is an outstanding honest service excellent prices highly recommend|1
ok i thought this was a nice place in a nice area after an amazing meal vivo li and went for a drink at this place they poured half the amount of one shot and when i tried to dispute it i had one drink the whole night so was not under the influence the server there not only took my drink and poured it down the sink but also did the same to my partners unbelievably rude service for no reason i cant believe that such a nice area in toronto would be subject to such atrocious customer service we went across the street to bar radio and had a blast please avoid game day at all costs|0
really cool party the taps were so clean and the linen had love been ironed probably with one of those irons thats really heavy i think those light weight irons are very bad very disappointing sometimes the steam is nothing more than a bunch of water dripping on your garment and then you iron just to get rid of the water but then it leaks even more its really hard to understand the settings on irons should it be set on cotton linen i mean i really dont know some irons take a long time to heat up and then there are other irons that ive noticed heat up very quick great party|1
great massage by casey very professional well trained and knowledgeable plus hes a super nice guy|1
was very disappointed with the staff and management i have been there three times and with almost every visit i came back unhappy the first stylist who cut my hair was great but the next two who did my highlights were sub par the first time i went in to get my highlights redone i was unhappy with the result and they offered to redo it i was satisfied with the redo i come back several months later to freshen my highlights up and again was unsatisfied with the outcome i called back to see if the could redo it and the director hinted at the fact that i was either lying and just wanted a free redo or that i didnt tell my stylist clearly what i wanted working in customer service myself i was shocked that anyone would speak to a customer like that i am very disappointed with my time there and will not return|0
ordered tools online waited 2 weeks nothing emailed an inquiry no reply just a refund 25 weeks after i ordered the tools screwed up my project left me looking for another retailer highly unprofessional online service|0
i have been twice since the remodel the first time the waiter talked three of us into getting guinness steak sandwich all the sandwiches were cold i decided not to eat it the other two guys sent is back and they microwaved them the second time we got philly sandwiches and they must have spilled a pepper caster on the sandwich two visits both sandwiches were bad so i will pass on a third visit|0
worst customer service came here the other day to take out a new installment loan and waited in line behind one person for 25 minutes and was never even helped to make matters worse there were 9 employees on the floor at once while i was waiting i was never greeted never acknowledged and never was served only when i decided to walk out of the store was when one employee shouted i can help you over here but was useless as i had a schedule to stick to and had to be on my way bottom line is this store sucks may be not the company but i definitely recommend going somewhere else for better customer service and loans|0
they hold your prescription hostage and wont give you refills unless you come in every 3 months i only wanted to switch to a cheaper prescription for which i still have one month on file and they want me to come in its all about the money|0

i can not stress how good the customer service is at this hertz location the manager there is extremely professional and polite i booked a car on two separate occasions during the same weekend and the service i received was outstanding on the second occasion i booked a standard car but was given a mid size instead as this was all they had in stock the manager came down to the car park to find me and tell me that when i brought the car back it was not necessary to fill the car up with gas all the way given i had booked for a standard the man cleaning the cars was also super friendly as were the other staff i rented from the dollar thrifty location on it antoine two weeks before and was treated like it was a privilege to rent a car from them it was the worst customer service i have ever experienced after my experience with hertz i wont be going anywhere else again to rent a car|1

i went to kal tire for my free flat repair saturday november 28 at 1100 am and was told they cant get me in until 34 oclock ok thats fine i said so ill come back around 230 no if i leave they wont get me in at all but ill be back way before youll get me in no they will not accommodate me at all and dont care how much inconvenience it is so no other options but to wait so i gave them my keys and said ill be waiting in my truck as im sitting in my truck i see 5 yes five vehicles that showed up hours after me and got in immediately but supposedly they wont make appointments on saturday and first come first serve so what makes these other people more special im wondering i paid way to much for my tires only because of their said to be great customer service just to see others being serviced immediately as they show up so now its 400 and im still waiting and seeing yet another woman that just arrived having her car serviced immediately wif i will never buy or deal with kal tire ever again best price and better warranty for tires is costco compare their prices and see for yourself|0
my coworker found this little gem she ordered take out and brought her lunch back to the office the aroma and looks of her lunch prompted me to stop in what a delicious treat the restaurant atmosphere is very clean smooth jazz playing in the back ground and incredibly friendly staff not to mention the scrumptious chicken curry cutlet dish the prices are very reasonable i encourage anyone to check this place out you will not be disappointed|1

i used to love this place because i wrongly assumed extremely high prices meant extremely good dry cleaning and customer care nope last week maroney i badly burned my adorable brand new 300 pants any rational person would assume they i do the right thing and pay me back for them instead charlotte the owner of maroney i called me and said i have bad news your pants are ruined because they were mislabeled you need to take them back to the store where you bought them i would almost buy that sad lie except for the fact that i had these very pants dry cleaned a week earlier at viking across the street with no issues i even showed them the little sticker still on the pants from viking i then called saks where i purchased the pants who also verified they are labeled properly ultimately after an in person visit and 2 phone calls to maroney i i decided to once again go down there in person with the receipt and an email from saks in hand to request charlotte make things right she flat out refused the worst customer service ive ever seen in my entire life she truly does not even care that i am out 300 and amazing pants because of what her company did very disappointing from a place where ive literally spent thousands of dollars over the last 5 years bottom line if maroney i destroys your clothing they will not take responsibility for it or compensate you doesnt seem right from the most expensive dry cleaner in the area|0
greg had my car running smoothly in a snap thank you so much|1

yey a new delicious brunch place atmosphere lovely good music well decorated place was clean feels like a patio with the doors open and sun shining in service quite new food took a bit longer than the usual time it would take at the chain brunch places like cor as but same time as other local like good lake or huevos the owners are really friendly nice type of welcoming friendly and not the fake overly friendly kind so that was nice food fantastic would definitely come back hubby had the ham and mushroom crepes i had the bonfire delicious but couldnt finish everything they gave a load of sausages the potatoes wedges are crispy and yummy other places give more fries than sausage but this place was generous although next time i will ask for more fries and less sausage had the iced coffee really good kind of reminds me of vietnamese ice coffee i would do walk ins for their coffee alone surprisingly better than starbucks price cheap and cheerful definitely would recommend although not sure about the sign it doesnt pop so we didnt notice it until now as we go to dani sushi nearby all the time|1
amazing authentic bangladesh food great decor as well try the much ka and fried po mah ret fish|1
i hired tara o grady eight months prior to my wedding because she seemed very nice over the phone and at our first visit as soon as we put the deposit down for full wedding planning although the site lists partial planning we were told this is no longer an option her demeanor instantly changed just to give you an idea the happiest day of my life was actually the day after the wedding because i knew i would never have to contact or see tara again she was a total nightmare to work with at times i thought my whole experience with her was part of some romantic comedy and that these things could not possibly happening to me based on the amount of time and money that we spent on her services and the wedding from a melting wedding cake to family heirlooms stolen from our home to misplaced bouquets to my vendors contacting me because she was always unavailable to her yelling at my mother it was all out some awful reality show i was left alone my whole wedding day that included having to keep the hair and make up team on track the photographer and videographer both of whom left early despite being paid for the night the bridal party almost left the house without our bouquets for our photoshoot until i asked where are the bouquets and my florist walked them over not tara she did have time to post photos of my wedding on insta gram during the actual wedding which i thought was in poor taste but a good example of her work ethic from the start tara was unwilling to suggest or meet with vendors that did not fall under her one or two selection of preferred vendors usually her friends i ended up having to do all the leg work though i havent lived in toronto for about sixteen years and work in chicago which is why i hired a wedding planner locally that included hair make up cake flowers and food and i had to hire meet with and negotiate all my own budgets and contracts even the simplest of tasks as finding a limo company and putting our guest list on a chalkboard became huge endeavors for her my hair and make up team told me that they had never experienced a wedding planner who failed to interact with them or the bride the day of the wedding multiple guests asked if we had considered hiring a wedding planner due to many mishaps that occurred honored guests not having a place sit for dinner bridal party not receiving food or drinks wine bottles that were purchased not being placed on the tables nor served the list goes on the day of the wedding tara insisted on coming at noon even though hair was arriving at 730 am and the set up for the wedding was incomplete i had to insist she come in at 830 when she did arrive she was late 930 and then disappeared to the backyard as nothing was set up even though staff had access to the venue for four days in advance and everything had been delivered and ready for set up days beforehand but she was too busy with another event it took me almost three months to calm down enough to post a review because the whole situation left me so distraught i truly hope no on else makes the same mistake i did by trusting bliss with planning a once in a lifetime occasion for additional specifics read below unable to meet after up in the afternoon does not respond to email or texts sometimes for weeks at a time uses her kids as an excuse not to meet or email or text since she would have to pick them up for school or go on weekend trips this made it extremely difficult to communicate with her or meet with potential vendors due to her limited availability doesnt work with any assistants or at least in our case didnt have one concerns and issues go unaddressed budget finalized two days before the event after we had paid everything errors in itinerary such as scheduling bridesmaid for hair first when she was not even in town as explained in five emails the catering staff unsupervised for the reception and did not serve the bridal party appetizers or sides that includes me and my husband fans were not ordered so my 1000 plus wedding cake melted and we had to use a regular knife to cut our cake even though we paid her company thousands of dollars to rent all the utensils and serving utensils sparkler exit did not happen despite buying sparklers antique bone china was stolen from our home by hired staff failed to show up for the pick up of rental items after the wedding or assist in supervision of clean up dissembling and packing up of items rental companies sent us invoices for missing items despite her company being in charge of what was ordered delivered and responsible for pick up we paid bliss over 30000 to act as middleman upon taras request|0

the easter bunny brought 45 in gift cards at giant eagle researched what parent company they associate with first so that i knew which ones to buy since this is the closest theater to our home we go to see furious 7 and the lady behind the desk kept swiping it like it was a credit card i said maam its a gift card with a scannable barcode she states that they dont have any technology that lets them scan anything i said well thats kind of false advertising then dont you think i asked for the manager but they were too busy so the easter bunny then paid cash to make the kids happy its clean and the staff is friendly although uneducated about technology or lack thereof ticket prices are lower so they make up for it at the snack bar|0

ate here with one other person sat in the open window on a warm night and it was a great and affordable meal we chose it for being one of the cheaper options in the area and having super cute ambiance wooden chairs outdoor seating video games projected on a wall the sashimi box was a really good deal for dinner that my dining companion got and i got a mushroom soup everything was delicious and more food than we could finish the beer was cold service was friendly they kept the water coming and the place is super cute and had a great little birthday celebration for another patron while we were there that was very festive but not too loud or obnoxious the ginger moscow mule usually called just a moscow mule in the us had ginger ale not ginger beer in it which isnt super typical and wasnt terribly delicious there are lots of other great fun cocktails on the menu and a cold sapporo went great with the meal just skip the moscow mule unless you want a vodka ginger ale overall will definitely want to go back here if i go back to montreal highly recommend for dinner with a friend a small birthday celebration or a date|1

from all the panda express that i have eaten at this is the only one that is stingy on the noodles and rice they also count the walnut honey shrimp one by one seriously today in particular there was this spanish speaking lady lady serving the food and she was vulgar while talking to her coworkers in spanish if this is a family oriented restaurant in the middle of the las vegas latino area the employees should be careful to show their true colors in any language it makes a bad impression of the owners and managers|0
this tim horton location is my go to location as it is the closest to my office the food is consistent and service is quick when you have those two in your favour you really can not complain i make a visit to this location more often than i would like they seriously put something addictive in their coffee and sandwiches their drive thru is 24 hours service which is an added bonus number college is down the street i have noticed a lot of students that hang out at this location for a quick bite good coffee or just a place to hang out drop by this tim horton if you are in the exhale area|1
my experience with these people was terrible i hadnt used a similar service before but while in town for a convention needed help with a delivery the person i spoke to on the phone wasnt very helpful and did not get enough information on the pick up while i understand that large venues are tough to pick up from that is the service i paid for it took so long to connect with the clearly irritated driver that i could have uber ed and couriered it all myself in less time|0

horrible service the girl in the dressing room was sweet to me but otherwise was treated as if i was a thief i came in to exchange a bra which i spend thousands and thousands of dollars at the store and i had worked there previously the girl at the counter told me you can exchange this job for this one but this broad is a nice surprise in the one you had bought she made me feel so little and was so very rude they followed me around like i was a puppy and insisted that they look in my purse i wish the girl at the counter would have gotten fired i do not appreciate being respected in such a manner i did nothing wrong and you be treated that way it was very horrible|0
i went to irene i to have my dress altered as she is backed by the bridal store where i got my wedding dress although the first visit was ok the second and third visit were extremely cramped and rushed i felt like irene was pushing me through the entire experience really quickly and not really listening to what i had to say she made some alterations many of which were well done but the biggest disappointment is that she cut my dress too short when i was walking down the isle you could see my feet coming out under the dress and in every shot you can see my feet as the dress was 12 am off the floor she assured me this is the way it is supposed to me so i could walk but i have never seen another bride where you could see her feet under a floor length dress before now every time i see a picture of me in the dress from the wedding it is ruined by the fact that my feet are showing secondly she changed the crinoline under my dress and it literally fell out from under my dress after less than an hour of dancing i had to go change my out fit as it was dragging on the floor and then completely detached overall i was not impressed with the experience the service or the alterations them self and i would not go back here if i had to do it again|0
rebel has good prices this location still offers 100 octane the rebel at trop and pecos never prints receipts at the pump which i always take so i have to go inside for a receipt not normally a problem but i dont want to reek of smoke just to get a receipt this rebel doesnt have smoking inside so if the pump happens to be out of paper which is rare at this location it takes but a moment to go inside and get a receipt|1

the only reason this is getting two stars is that someone put a lot of money and effort into the interior it stops there there literally was nothing to mix no sour mix no lime juice no grenadine nothing basic liquor bottom shelf at that the bartender while pleasant had no knowledge base no bar experience the girls were pregnant grumpy and covered in tattoos there were only three i was told it was hit or miss this was a wednesday but it really shouldnt matter for a city bar 10 cash only cover this place needs to do the following to stay in business 1 hire an experienced bartender full time and pay them have that person train up three more 2 is invest in some bar stock really 3 hire some girls from other clubs that actually work out and take care of themselves who havent ruined themselves with three kids with one on the way 4 get e new do is music that is all that was played it killed me|0

the owner of this daycare is only concerned about maximizing her profits she is unethical and lacks common sense whatever you do do not prepay anything if you are unhappy then your e out of luck it is strategic on her part you dont come back and she keeps your money she has 400500 of my money she is not concerned with keeping her customers happy which obviously would lead to a larger customer base and more profit she does not listen and is very confrontational i no longer trust her with the wellbeing of my dog|0

this car wash cuts corners on every turn the water quality is terrible they dont give you very much soap when washing their brushes are stiff and leaves swirls in the cars paint their wash bay loads end to end so you spray the person in front of you or end up getting sprayed yourself on top of all that it is very expensive do yourself a favour and go over to big bucket car wash in crowfoot|0

i stopped by walkers this past friday for the first time you could instantly tell it was a hometown bar but i never felt unwelcome the bartender promptly told us the drink specials and offered us a menu and within minutes we had our first drink beer they had a great offering of different micro brews but feeling un adventurous that night i stayed with what they had on tap which they had around 8 different varieties food i ordered the double bacon cheeseburger and it was massive the burger was a little overcooked because i like to see blood but was still very juicy it came with any of the usual toppings you would like i only went with lettuce tomato and onion the side was a full basket of fries all for around 11 which for the size and amount was a good deal i also got a side order of parmesan wings the wings were also very juicy and the flavor was great pros it is very clean the service was great and the food hit the mark for the prices cons i am not a smoker and this is a smoking bar if you are bothered by smoke you will not like this place conclusion smoke does not bother me so i visiting walkers again in the future disclaimer this review is the opinion of a person that loves to drink vast quantities of alcohol so sometimes views are skewed by the end of the night|1

weve been driving past this spot for years and always wanted to try it a group of us went on friday evening and it was a blast first the food if youve never had filipino food before the buffet is a perfect introduction though i would avoid the fish it is tala pia which isnt a very good fish the pork belly is rich and buttery smooth with just a hint of spice all the vegetable dishes were really tasty the real star here is the barbecued skewers of pork and chicken that they cook fresh outside on the patio the service is fast and friendly though a little chaotic due to the crush of people on a friday night if you have a large enough group and are feeling like a real party book the budd as table which is a communal dinner of just about everything on the menu served on grape leaves and rice it has to be seen to be believed|1

i have overlooked several issues at the medina enterprise but i will no longer go to enterprise i rent a lot and have dealt with this same woman at the medina enterprise for a while and really cant believe she has worked there so long now my last rental she said there were two small dents on the bumper when the sun is out you dont see them with the glare and you really hardly see them without the sun i believe i missed them when i picked up the vehicle but normally when i would mention this type ding most employees always tell me its no big deal and dont even mark them down the woman that has been working there for quite a while now walks around with a ruler type thing to inspect the car i have been renting for a while and i have told myself many times and after other major issues that i needed to go somewhere else but i kept coming back now she told me she would request other reports that had this vehicle to see if these two small dings were reported on other reports and she would give me a call any other agent wouldnt write down these two small dings so i doubted it was going to show up so i asked her how much it would cost she said it would cost whatever my deductible was for my insurance this makes no sense but i am glad my deductible isnt 1000 i still could have gotten it fixed under my deductible but i waited for her call the problem is she never called me she just charged my credit card without any call or explanation of charges i have no idea if they even replaced the bumper as she said would happen for two small dings so i hope if anyone else rents it they are very careful to notice two small dings on the bumper or they will be charged too charging my account without calling or letting me know if the final straw when i should have stopped going there after other major issues that i overlooked its funny how those major issues like my vehicle accelerating on its own wasting my time and money to have to find another enterprise to switch vehicles was okay but now i have to pay for two dings that i didnt even do i wont make the mistake of renting from them again|0
unfortunate and disappointing way to handle a customer im a remote buyer and made contact with salesman chris vole i was interested in a cherry red 2015 ram crew cab 1500 i asked to see what the dealer did to the vehicle to prep it for sale i was provided the checklist the checklist indicated the hybrid system was in working order and that the hybrid battery pack was okay i immediately questioned chris and his first response was that the dealership used that section for flex fuel vehicles i then called mitch axelrod to inquire further because i knew i was being given ridiculous info thats when chris got back to me to let me know that the service person who performed the check list was let go because he got sloppy i was still seriously interested in the vehicle and asked mitch to have the vehicle rechecked neither mitch nor chris ever got back to me please do your homework and thoroughly review information received from this dealership|0

this place isnt going to last long we have been here to eat twice in case you are wondering why i would give a restaurant one star yet go back again let me explain we love mongolian grill and after recieving a flyer in the mail we decided to check it out the first time we went was at 330 in the afternoon we found the grill offered only three or four vegetables and the only seasoning available was garlic and a container of salt small as the grill offerings were there was very little left in the pans the buffet items were the standard fare they werent bad but nothing special i also noticed that many of the offerings had small amounts of food left we thought perhaps we had come after a huge lunch rush and the staff hadnt had time to get caught up yet the fact that nothing was replaced in the 40 minutes we were there should have given us a clue in fact i had to ask for soup bowls and spoons as none were out for use and the staff didnt even seem to notice until i brought this to their attention still we were willing to give this place another chance we went back a week later for dinner at 800 once again half of both the grill offerings and buffet items were out and never restocked even though i asked two different workers if they could please bring out more noodles onions chicken and beef for the grill believe it or not each of them directed me to ask someone else to restock one item on the grill was finally restocked the chicken when the worker brought out a fresh pan instead of replacing the old pan with the new one he just dumped the new meat into the old pan on top of the old meat that remained and this was raw chicken we are talking about i gave up on the grill and turned to the buffet items the ones that were left all three soups were at the bottom of the pot the sauces had scum on top from sitting so long the pot stickers had hardened around the edges and it was obvious other items had been sitting there for hours or probably most of the day empty dishes and water glasses were never refilled or collected worse still the counters on the food lines were covered with food spills and never wiped down some pans had food items from different pans in them serving spoons and tongs were filthy as if they had never been changed if this is how the front of the restaurant is kept i cant even imagine what the back looks like i would like to add that at both times we we visited there were only about ten customers so being busy really wasnt a viable reason for the slovenly and unhealthy upkeep the health dep at ment is going to have a field day hopefully they read this review and visit soon before someone gets very ill there are several chinese buffets around with similar names the people who posted good reviews for this place must be mixed up with a different panda buffet than this one thats the only logical reason i can fathom for their positive comments|0
i took a perfectly fine boat in for spring routine maintenance and his man to re my boat apart and said it would cost more than the boat was worth to fix it then laughed in my face when i said that it didnt make sense i had no choice but to pay him to put the boat back together and yes just as mentioned in his other reviews the price kept going up and the time it took to fix the boat went from a week to one day yet the labor cost didnt change as i and every other reviewer has said here this guy is clearly a crook and doesnt even try to pretend to be honest i later learned he was making fun of the two women with the boat who he took for everything he could to another customer wow that made me feel so completely taken and furious hope this was enough detail for you yelp it was a super bad experience a pure scam and cost me thousands of dollars|0
stay away i would give her zero stars but that is not an option they are disorganized nonresponsive and drastically changed the original price they gave me three months later classic bait and switch i had been insured by a previous company for the last 17 years but through the process of getting quotes for home owners insurance learned that i could save nearly 100 a month by going with lynn buss version of state farm coverage unfortunately this was too good to be true while my insurance was cheaper for 3 months despite having no change in my driving record suddenly they said that based on further review my insurance price would nearly double a good agent would have provided an accurate amount at the outset rather than drastically change it 3 months later they had all of the information available to review my driving record but did not do so this hinges on fraudulent and i am back with my original carrier your review helps others learn about great local businesses please dont review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review or if your e connected in any way to the owner or employees|0
i took my car for a routine maintenance my car was there from 1100 am until after up the driver that dropped me off at home and picked me up was very pleasant but the next day the brakes on my car stopped working in the middle of me driving the car which i dont have to explain why thats upsetting and dangerous my brake fluid replacement was not done right and my driveway was stained and my car had to be towed at night and left at the dealership overnight and i had to uber home the next day when i showed up my service manager didnt even know why i was there again i felt that this was not taken seriously because i had to speak with the manager to get any kind of apology on the paper work they wrote customer mentioned brake light was on or something like that lol no my brakes stopped working in the middle of me driving it while i had a 7 month old in the back seat because i brought it here the guest relation person emailed regarding and survey as they do automatically and when i replied letting them know i was not happy they never replied so yeah id rather drive to the original dealership in cali where i bought it than risk something worse happening for the next maintenance edit i got a call after leaving this review missed it and dont really know what speaking about the situation would do they have my email because ive explained what has happened no one worked with me towards a resolution thats it still dont recommend this dealership|0

the idea is great portrait services in short order but we werent seen until a good half hour or more past are appointment time while our photographer was pleasant enough she was clearly not a well trained photographer she made no adjustment of lights and it shows in our photos and there are some deep shadows odd crops and parts of faces overexposed what she was really there to do was sell photo packages and its all about up sell up sell up sell as i said she was pleasant enough and knew how to take no for an answer so that annoyance was avoided overall however the quality is just subpar i think you could get better portraits from a high school photography class|0

this place has the worst customer service ever the front desk staff are a joke i checked in 15 minutes before my appointment and a full 35 minutes later they called me up to ask for a copy of my insurance card i am a returning customer and they already have that information on file i asked when i might be actually see my doctor and they told me that he had just checked in his 2 oclock appointment that he was running a full hour behind i asked why wouldnt you have informed me that when i checked in so that i could be prepared for a longer wait in which the front desk receptionist became extremely pissy with me and told me she had 100 patients to check in and that she was beyond busy and short staffed and yet in the 35 minutes i sat there she literally checked checked in one extra person besides me and a place only has five people in the entire lobby between three doctors when i express my displeasure instead of trying to empathize she just rambled on a lot of nonsense and told me if i left the building i could not come back again its not that i dont understand doctors can get behind but it was the absolute rudeness an absolute i dont give a crap attitude that was unbelievable to me i will be finding a new doctor to help me with my diabetes from now on you cant treat people like crap and expect people to stay loyal to your business the doctors in the back room better start teaching their staff to treat patients kindly or they will be out of business soon|0

i should have known by how short and rude they were on the phone that this wasnt going to be the place for me when i arrived i was barely greeted and i got the feeling i was bothering them by being there my stylist did not introduce herself to me the entire time i was there for 2 hours for a cut and color did not offer a beverage ask if she could set my purse somewhere so it sat awkwardly next to me in the chair for the entire appointment etc during my consult i showed her a picture of what i wanted and she was absolutely rude and condescending she told me we werent on the same page with what we thought were highlights and different coloring techniques i didnt think the customer had to know all the lingo when dealing with a professional stylist who turned out to be a the owner she did not attempt to make conversation or make me feel comfortable or welcomed the whole time icing on the cake is that my hair did not turn out a thing like what i showed her and the color is awful i have to admit the cut is good but not good enough to redeem this bad experience|0

i will try to keep this short but i have lived here for 1 year and 6 months now so forgive me if i dump too many details problems started when i moved in the day i moved in con am was the owner of the complex at the time i came in to my apartment the day i signed my lease and i found womens hair stands in the bathroom and a couple in the kitchen there were strains on the wall and it appeared the place hadnt really been cleaned by professionals next problem was a few months later i had a literally crazy neighbor who was always screaming and yelling at her boyfriend one night i caught her downstairs breaking a window to another persons unit because she had to save the cat i called the police and thats where the real problems began every week or so she would come to my door screaming and banging when i advised the front office i never received a response until i told them i was going to break my lease if they did not act they said it was out of their hands which shocked me when i learned she wasnt even a resident here but just my neighbors girlfriend this is private property and they can set a no trespassing order on a disruptive individual this continued for several months next problem was when marina ridge took over this might seem petty to some but not to me i was working two jobs and their office was always closed when i was off work and closed when i went in to work in the morning i was used to paying my rent online with con am and i could not get in touch with the new office to see if they had that option and they would also never return my calls finally i had a couple of hours the very day after rent was due and told them i had been trying to call them for the past four days to find out how to get them their money i asked that they please waive the late fees as a customer service courtesy but the lady said no because then shed have to waive everyone elses fees really the only reason i renewed my lease with marina ridge is for the price i only pay 560 for a one bedroom if you are paying any more they are ripping you off this place is old and rundown i only signed for six months but from december to now there have been some minor problems for me and one critical problem on their side with regard to how to run a business i had a leak in my ceiling whenever it rained i had to notify them by phone several times but they would never return my calls so i had to send an email they fixed it but the ceiling still gets damp when it rains i dont really think their staff are educated or even licensed contractors for that matter the next thing is very petty but it made me hate this place even more they painted the whole complex an oppressive ugly ridiculous cinderblock gray with a greenish brownish trim around the windows and the doors are bright sea green then the new maintenance people think its okay to just come in even when you havent received notice they are coming in ive had to put a piece of wood at my door so they cant just waltz in finally i was trying to give a 60 day notice that i was vacating i again called to ask if i needed to sign something i also emailed and no response when i went into the office it was 56 days before the end of my lease so now they have forced me to pay them for four extra days after my lease should have ended today would and should have been my last day about three weeks ago they inspected my apartment because they are going to renovate it and upgrade it after i move out if they try to charge me ridiculous fees for cleaning and what not i will be livid they are going to tear out all the carpet and tear apart the kitchen and all the fixtures i know because ive seen them do this to the apartments around me when they are renovated obviously i am going to leave it very clean but still this place is ridiculous and id be naive to believe my problems have ended just because my lease is over on june 4 2013|0

i just called to get some information about possibly having my cat put down which is obviously a very emotional conversation to have in the first place he is 16 and is having seizures and has completely lost control of his bowels i have known him for 16 years and i can see that he is uncomfortable the person i spoke to was rude and cold and did not give me any answers aside from saying 16 is not old for a cat i ended up just hanging up the phone because i was so shocked that someone could be so detached and unhelpful she provided me with no information but at least i can confidently say that i will not be bringing my cat here for his final moments i know a lot of pet owners in the neighbourhood and i will be telling all of them to stay away from here as well may be do munn is nice but they should really hire more personable front desk staff|0

first of all let me say this review is in no way an indictment of the folks who work there the staff have always been nice helpful and friendly i have no complaints about them what i do have a beef with is the obviously very poor management if your e not fighting off the meth heads who essentially live by the payphones your e accosted by the homeless mentally ill and people the store has allowed to sell candy outside the door it feels like im always dodging someone just to get in the door i live just down the street and go in there almost daily i can not begin to tell you how many times in a month their soda fountain is inoperable either there is no ice for the fountain drinks no diet coke no coke no sprite etc its always something then their ability to process credit and debit goes down a lot also the gas pumps are so old and so scratched up with gang graffiti a person can not possibly read the meter when getting gas and if you have a fry card it will not read it at the pump to give you a discount and you must go inside where there is usually a very long line and wait for the clerk to punch your card numbers in its really too bad this circle i has been allowed by corporate to get this bad corporate really needs to do a serious overhaul at this store along with hiring security at night if i didnt live so close by i would never go in there|0
my wife and i went to see woods law to have trent review our existing will and trust because we just wanted to make sure everything was in order trent looked over all of our stuff asked us some questions about our situation and our goals and then informed us that our documents were in pretty good shape overall he explained how our plan would work and then told us about some of the weaknesses in our plan and gave us some options and recommendations on possible revisions to ensure our plan worked how we wanted it to he gave us a lot to think about and took a lot of time to explain the pros and cons on each option it was really helpful and gave us a lot of peace of mind knowing how things would work if either of us were to die or get seriously hurt trent didnt try to sell us on anything and didnt push us at all he told us that if he was in our shoes he wouldnt pay money to redo the will or trust yet he actually turned down work when he probably could have talked us into redoing our estate plan and making a bunch of money off of us but he didnt we felt he was being really honest and had our best interests in mind rather than his id feel really comfortable going back to trent again thanks again|1
do was desperate to go to a canadian walmart so we take the car out of the parking garage first mistake drive nearly an hour through traffic only to find out that walmart apparently closes some time before 815pm on a sat night while were out in the burbs we thought wed find a place to grab some dinner second mistake after driving around for nearly two hours we end up a block from our hotel nearly 10pm at night guido and angelina i it was nice and quiet and we were seated quickly i had the penne romanoff kinda like penne in vodka sauce and do had tortellini gigi al cardinal meat tortellini in rose sauce the bread was really good fresh and warm the service was super fast almost too fast as if the food was already prepared and just warmed in the oven this is why i took a star off otherwise we were extremely happy with our meal and only wish we had saved ourselves the time of driving aimlessly around montreal for no apparent reason|1

i am not giving these types of reviews often but i hope that this will help you to avoid the frustration i waited 15 hour to see the doctor the website mentioned a 5 minutes wait anyway i saw do ibrahim i went to the pharmacy in the evening but it turns out the drug prescribed was not available in canada how does a canadian doctor not know that the clinic would not fax an updated version of the drug to the pharmacy they said it would take 48 hours which i couldnt wait obviously in the end i had to go to a different clinic to update the prescription|0
the sales the assistants are pushy and i got the sense that they were not being genuine every time i passed one of their associates on the way to and from the fitting room to the mirror they would make a positive comment about the way the dress looked or how popular the style is etc it felt very forced and it was almost like they are trained to do so to push along the sale the sales associate who was helping me was friendly enough but they dont let you go through the racks yourself to select dresses the associate will take your instruction and then bring dresses to you i didnt like this at all i did find one dress that i loved but they were so pushy and would barely give me 1 minute alone with my mom to discuss the details so i left it|0
the absolute best omelette ive ever had it was cooked perfect had plenty of goodies inside big portion also hash browns were also good and toast is toast i go here for my omelette fix it really is awesome|1
absolutely the worst chinese food i have ever eaten i just wasted 30 of hard earned money they also made a big mistake with my order i ordered 2 of the combos that are supposed to come with wonton soup and rice they delivered the principal plates instead which were more expensive and i did not get any rice or soup and when i called to let them know they refused to fix it the beef broccoli had a strange smell to it and the beef was grey the poulet bananas looked like it was deep fried 2 days ago and then just reheated and it had a very small amount of sauce and burnt pineapple chunks would not recommend|0
this is a great little bike shop with very knowledgeable and helpful staff doing good things for bike enthusiasts and the community in general i got my bike there at a great bargain and got a complimentary tune with it i also noticed that they have some pretty interesting specialty bikes for sale so i may be going back for a jacked up cruiser|1

detail i did a full polish on my best friends truck 3 times every time it was covered in swirls and totally not acceptable every time he brought it back they would swear it would be perfect next time now the paint is getting very thin in places it was a 2 year old truck and the paint is in very good shape not old and dried out my truck was backed into while sitting in their lot picking his truck up the second time while he was away at work my truck was parked directly in front of the shop for roughly 3 hours when it was backed into quite hard about 4000 worth of damage hard they have ca cameras that it is clearly in view of asked about the cameras and video footage stories went from it wasnt in view to yes we saw it nothing hit it that entire day must have happened elsewhere pretty shady soren the owner said he would at least pay my deductible in good faith awesome then he changed his mind and he would pay half okay now i feel like im getting played well its been almost a full year and a few phone calls and no half no nothing just a poor polish job and a damaged truck with a ton of shade ness|0

someone mentioned customer service its nonexistent in this place two people see you standing there waiting to order they act as if they dont see you and if you are lucky enough to get your order taken they give you looks like you are there to take their money away and not the opposite i walked out of that place and will never step foot again in it even if its the last place in town for ce papi but luckily there is others that do their job way better than this lot|0

i came to charlotte to take class at ya yoga after my good friend raved about it it was well worth the journey we took a single shot class and it was fun challenging and grounding i took many a childs pose out of exhaustion and felt absolutely no shame doing so even though most of my fellow classmates seemed very athletic and clearly had done ya more than a few times i felt welcome and accepted as a newcomer i also have to say that i loved the teachers message during the class he emphasized listening to your body and prioritizing health above pushing yourself beyond your limits this kind of language was so appreciated since i havent taken a hot yoga class since january and was dying at certain points during the class ie heart beating a million times a minute sweating to the point where i was worried my body wouldnt have water left my hamstrings are sore and im already planning a trip back to charlotte to take class again|1

i have been going to susan for many years for electrolysis and now for permanent make up she is nice fun smart and cares that you get the result you want she will not try and talk you into more procedures or spending more money unnecessarily she does what you request or will tell you delicately if she advises against it for your own good i wanted to do permanent make up on my brows and she told me that is is for people who dont have brows and i should just dye mine myself she is gentle patient and reasonably priced i wouldnt trust anyone else and recommend her without hesitation and i wouldnt waste time writing this if i couldnt give her a 100 endorsement i schedule my appointments at the end of her day so that i get to spend more time with her because we never have enough time to talk during my appointments if you have dogs bring pictures with you|1
this park is absolutely fantastic and worth the entrance fee there is plenty of parking and even a real restroom but the true reason it shines it is absolutely isolated camelback hikers will be shocked at the few people they will see i park at overton merge to go john i do the go john loop in its entirety and end up coming back down overton the way i came it is a lollipop loop for those looking for a loop plenty of hills an occasional rattlesnake and gorgeous views in a little over 9 miles takes about 2 hours running hiking there just arent enough good things to say about this park|1
i rented a house in gilbert for yrs from relax infinity i heard never rent from a property management company and now i know why moving out is nearly impossible to ensure you get your full deposit back i have been a perfect renter for yrs the owner was sad to see me go i left the house in more than excellent condition i took care of the home like it was my own needless to say they kept 220 hard earned dollars of mine and cant provide to me why they are charging me that amount go to bob and see more negative comments about this property management company dont rent from this franchise and if you find yourself in my same scenario file with the justice court and read your tenant rights ben wont call me back always in a meeting janet wont call me back and lisa just says ben is in meetings all day and she will give the message renters have rights call maricon courts at 602 372 8300 for next steps|0

avoid tiffany like the pal huge i told her what i wanted and yes it was my first time every professional stylist i have ever met takes this into account anyway i said what i wanted and then she went to town with the buzzer my hair went from naturally colored with some wings to completely grey on the side i stopped her and asked for the barber immediately actually first off i also asked for a beard trim and she said she couldnt do it so i asked for the barber may be she should have just given me to the barber no she went ahead anyway luckily there was a good barber on staff who knew what she was doing if you are a man make sure you get the real barber anyway i have vented enough if you need a real barber or haircut there are numerous other places around here that seem better price and like they have been in business longer than this place so go there instead is the best advice i can give|0
do you know what they call the doctor who finishes in last place in medical school they call him doctor such is the case of the psychiatrist at open arms counseling in henderson no i take kwon ip in which is a controlled medication it means its addicting i take it for anxiety and i have taken it for more than half my life i also had a serious migraine condition when i was much younger and it helped dramatically im not proud that i need to take kwon ip in everyday i am not even happy about it i am however grateful that i live in a time where a medication such as this exists and has given me a chance to have a life i dont just pop a pill and everything is fine i have fought hard for my life from not being able to function at all to doing everything i have ever wanted with new goals all the time this doctor called me a drug addict what an ass yes im addicted ive been taking it for years but i havent ever abused it or sold it or given it to friends i have given the eulogy at both my parents funerals and i didnt ever take an extra pill not even when a friend of mine was killed on 911 he said why look at you youve become so addicted it no longer affects you like i was some rare case study in his medical school midterm my family has a history of epilepsy and when i told him i had a grand mal seizure last year he said it was probably caused by the kwon ip in oooo ummm egg what a buffoon when he left the room i pulled up the new england journal of medicine and a huge article of how kwon ip in was created to reduce seizures or the severity of them at least it is the most non invasive drug there is unless you are allergic to it or have been on it for a long time and stop abruptly it is the last thing that will cause a seizure when i showed him the article he said that doesnt make it right wif he looked up my history and said you recently had a prescription yeah from a neurologist who said i needed to get it from you i dont need it today but i dont want to be that person who stops it abruptly this inexperienced uninformed man who probably got his degree from the back of a box of captain crunch should not be working with people shoes sure tin cans fine people animals absolutely not this doctor at open arms has a closed mind and no heart to speak of whatsoever all he knows is what he could memorize from a text book his last words to me were i dont treat drug addicts he may be able to call me and millions like me an addict but if he likes being called doctor he may wanna chill out with the adjectives|0

we bought my husbands 2006 ford focus in february 2011we had 2 days to buy a car so my husband could drive to el paso to go back to work i liked that they allowed us to take the car out of state the very next day after buying it we lived close so i would go in on sunday to make my car payment one day i went up there and they just randomly became closed on sundays i started making my payments on mondays with the managers permission they all of the sudden scolded me about making my payment on mondays even though i got permission through the manger then i got the info for making payments online cause i moved to the other side of town i got a letter on 3272012 that stated as of 3312012 they would be closed down and another finance company bought my loan and i would receive the information from them i got the paperwork and noticed that my loan was extended to june 2013 when my loan should have been up on february 2013 i called the finance company and they said that integrity put that i was 8 payments that is 4 months behind on my loan i have paid all my payments with my debit card and had proof that i have never missed a payment the finance company also told me that they did report me to the credit bureau as being behind and not paying for 4 months for anyone who has gotten a car there and had their loans bought out please check the amount that they say you owe they took 1600 of what i paid and said it wasnt paid and then sold the loan so the new company also paid an extra 1600 for the loan now i cant even go to the integrity website or get a hold of them to get what payment history they have on file|0

speaking badly sarcastically about your customers and their orders and they hear your sarcasm is never a positive thing young man your e not suited for customer service and if the young girl is your manager then you both need to appreciate your jobs and or seek another job other than that the coffee was good so the 1 star is for service apparently other reviewers have felt similarly|0
whatever you do dont let them schedule you for up or later they told me to come in at 3 even after i asked if that was enough time they assured me yes but they were closing at 4 or 430 so everything became very rushed with an undertone of stress and short changing on both the services i paid and then stupidly tipped well for plus the haircut gave me a sort of mullet instead of the bob i requested but again no time to fix it or even do the styling we agreed upon beforehand as staff wanted to go and i was the last customer in the place i replied to an email ad the owner sent me asking why they scheduled me so late and how i felt shortchanged on services but they didnt have the courtesy or customer service ethic enough to answer me luckily i was going out of town so i went to a salon in that city a few days later and a student cut my hair for free better than the seasoned stylist i had even if you get the time not sure theyre up to date with styles or care about people who arent their long time locals also since the manicurist wanted to leave to bake cookies my nails are all lopsided and not very prettily manicured|0
i have had the worst experience in a hair saloon ever went in to book sat morning to make sure i was booked with a stylist that understood what i needed for my hair anyway was reassured there was no problem the stylist i was matched with would be able to handle all my needs after she arrived 15 minutes late for our appointment i explained exactly that the bleach my last stylist used was not harsh and anyway i to make a long story short i was assured she had been doing hair for 8 years i have been crying since she showed me my hair 815 she told me the purple hair would go away in a couple of washes around my face i said to fix it she put some dye around it blew my hair dry and still tried to sell me on the colour please do not think you are going to a top notch salon shannon peeved|0

horrible they spread cream cheese like its severely rationed as if it was butter make sure you tell them to do it right or walk away the store set up is terrible as well you have to choose a bagel but can not see what the topping options are because they are around a corner yet they are rushing you to make a decision ive given them 3 chances and they have not earned me as a customer in fact i have complained to head office these franchisees have no idea how to run a business they barely speak english which makes it even worse stay away|0
i think this place still reels from past management or cooks or something else but even in the 7 months that i have lived here the place has improved tremendously sometimes the hubby and i come here for a cocktail lunch and things are pretty status quo i do see that there are a bunch of fun new additions to the menu and we are always satisfied often drink specials are pretty good too service here is always good particularly because it isnt normally packed the owners often float around who are adorable this sunday we went for the brunch it was an amazingly delicious surprise and ill tell ya why the owner and his wife actually cook some of the delicious homemade offerings at the buffet pasta salads sausage patties desserts you can absolutely tell that this isnt flash produced dishes also the food goes beyond typical eggs potatoes and meat but they are all good too there were salads fruits and veggies grits a carving station omelet station biscuits gravy and did i say cake cocktails are also on special we sat on the patio where there was a mellow and very cool sax player it was really all you could ask for on a sunday if you have had a marginal experience in the past try it again and take note of all the extras that the owners are bringing to the table no pun intended|1
eyelashes look great she was very accommodating and my eyes didnt burn at all during process unlike other places already getting compliments from strangers as well|1

lol these girls that work in the front office have absolutely no idea what they are doing went in this place about a month ago to get cleaning and rays was told i need a deep cleaning let them know that my insurance didnt kick in till this month so postponed the treatment i was told that the scaling and cleaning was a basic service and it was going to cost me 1100 dollars if i came out of pocket for it they even gave me a print out telling the price now that i have insurance i call them back and all the sudden its not a basic service and i have to come out of pocket over 250 dollars plus deductible of 50 dollars for an 1100 dollar service that i am covered for 85 of that i have a calendar year maximum of 1500 lol math does not add up on top of that whoever talked to me the first time today put me on hold then transferred me to some snobby broad with an attitude trust me take it from a marine corps veteran im sure the dentists are nice but the front staff seriously need to go back to school|0

i bought a group on deal for a 15 gel shellac manicure i made sure to read the fine print which said an appointment was required and there was an extra 10 charge for gel polish removal because i made an appointment and i did not need polish removal i assumed i would have a relaxing manicure and would not need to worry about additional charges other than tip boy was i wrong as soon as i mentioned i had a group on i was told that it only included the gel polish and the manicure would be 10 extra i immediately showed my nail tech the fine print which said nothing about an extra manicure charge i was then approached by three employees trying to show me where the group on said the manicure was an extra charge the wording they showed me still did not specifically say anything about extra charges at that point i just wanted my nails done so i could get the heck out of there im not the type the argue belligerently over 10 when all was said and done i overpaid for a mediocre gel manicure and the staff was rude at best its safe to say i will not be returning|0

my story is quite similar to others on here after a good amount of time spent back and forth both via phone conversations and texts with the owner shelley i was able to move onto the next step to be considered for ownership of one of her rescues she and i spoke about which rottweiler may be suitable for my home as well as which rottweilers would fit in with my current pups she made several suggestions which i completely agreed with but fell through because their current foster parents decided to adopt them thats no problem i understand that this happened three or four times one night i happened to be volunteering with her on a dog walk when she told me she had a puppy for me that just became available that the owners were unable to take care of she told me the puppy would be in town within the next several days and would be available for me when it came time for me to take the puppy she informed me that the adoption fee was going to be 850 her website states that the puppies are 350 with everything included she proceeded to tell me that the 850 was included his shots chip and him having his tail docked and being neutered when i questioned her further on why the price changed i quoted her website prices to her she became extremely abusive and basically called me a terrible dog owner i then told her that i would still pay the 850 because i had already promised a new dog to my wife she continued with her verbal abuse until i realized that clearly this woman was not going to let this dog come home with me she continued her verbal abuse by saying that for me to even consider going to a dog breeder i am doing great harm to the breed i am here to tell you that through my experience with her that she may not be running the most legitimate business with the animals interest at heart there are many wonderful breeders in the area that charge a very reasonable price for purebred rottweiler puppies if for some reason you are rejected or the price of the rescue triples free to email me at ayontz1 yahoo com and i can provide several local breeders contact info so you find a beautiful purebred rottweiler without taking any verbal abuse or hassle|0

the variety here can not be beat you can order one of their preset poutine i or you can do a custom on a handy sheet they give you ticking off what type of fries gravy and toppings you want portions were sun per generous two people will definitely get full off of one order we ordered three for five of us and later that night three of my friends shared a large order we took to go beers can be pretty cheap they had specials if there were hockey games on but even so pitchers were a decent price there was a long line when we went around prime dinner time 7 am but the hostess found a place to squeeze us in fairly quickly if you are willing to wait eat there because the order we took to go wasnt as good after the gravy and cheese curds got cold|1
beware for cake ordering i ordered a custom cake and when i arrived for pick up i could not believe the unprofessional appearance of the cake apparently teenagers decorate these cakes and no adult supervises or checks the cake had 6 or 8 12 oreos on a large rectangle cake and big block letters with the message with one of letters visibly corrected so it looked like a brown lump with sparse cookies and ugly lettering no nice borders around edges like in the pictures online the manager was not on site and took it 2 days for me to call to reach her the staff is nice and the kids on staff redecorated a little better and manager was apologetic everyone loved the taste of the cake but i would recommend just getting a pre decorated cake from the store and write in message yourself since your handwriting is likely better than the decorator on hand|0

the menu is simple follow a couple of steps pick your fish flavour and spice level we tried the oysters the shrimp king crab cajun fries and then the cajun fried rice you are given plastic gloves paper plates plastic cups and plastic cutlery a bucket arrives for the shells the fish comes in clear plastic bags the fish is steamed and then seasoned the fish is really delicious the flavours we chose were spicy and garlic get ready to get dirty eating here we enjoyed the food but the plastic plates cups and cutlery is not my choice especially for the prices also i didnt like getting our food out of plastic bags|1

i was at this driving school a little over a year ago i had the worst experience with it first of all only half of knowledge about driving road signs right of way etc is taught during the in class segment of the driving school then you drove without knowing the other important half of it my driving instructor was kiran not only did kiran made me feel like i wasnt an adequate driver giving them the benefit of the doubt i was totally new behind the wheel however she could have handled the situation better especially if you are dealing with a completely new driver but also completely trauma ut ized me about driving and ruined my confidence about it that wasnt the biggest problem though during my lesson kiran was on her phone while i was driving i had a feeling that something about that wasnt right so after my lesson with her i talked to my dad and brother about it and they reassured me that a driving instructor should not be on their phone for personal reasons my friends who have taken her lessons added that they would drive her to places for personal reasons as well i felt very unsafe and my dad pulled me out of the driving school while on the phone they denied that they had any record of me being enrolled every lesson kiran always asked me so when are you going to pay since the down payment has been paid but not the rest money is a huge thing for them i saw this yelp review from a woman whose son was also enrolled to this driving school they mentioned that these 5 star reviews are most likely from friends and family in order to attract customers i get money is a huge thing but it was very pushy i took am a driving school a month after apex and passed and gained my confidence back i now have a full drivers license now but it definitely took me a while emotionally to gain my confidence about driving i dont want anyone going through this again especially if you are a new and somewhat of a nervous driver like me please be beware of this driving school i wouldnt be surprised if they denied anything that happened in this review as they did with the other 1 star reviews but please be aware feel free to message me if you have any questions about my experience im honestly happy to help|0
the wedding that i was attending had a block of rooms at the this hotel i called the hotel to reserve a room the reservation process was very pain free driving up to the hotel you can tell the hotel is more a transient property the exterior is well maintained and cleaned plenty of parking available upon entering the hotel brandon front desk representative had greeted me informed me about amenities of the hotel and then checked me in the lobby was quaint with several chair and a fireplace plenty of seating areas once i had entered the room and starting to check things out i had checked in on yelp com apparently the hotel was offering an up grade offer on yelp after informing brandon i was able to upgrade to a king room with a jacuzzi sweet decor of the room is okay the bathroom was very spacious with a great large shower no tub the main room was a good size with a king bed plenty of seating refrigerator microwave and of course a jacuzzi the bed was very comfortable i will say the room was very sound proof dont hear anything from the near by rooms the following morning a continental breakfast is included the breakfast is a typical continental breakfast with some cold and hot items overall good experience some of the other amenities of the hotel include small fitness center washer dryer area and plenty of vending machines the morning agent was a little brisk with me and other guests otherwise the great was great and would recommend this property nearly forgot to mention very close to the interstate|1
terrible customer service unsure of associates name but she had long black hair and dark eyebrows i wore a pair of heels i bought last week to dinner one time and had to take them off because of the pain i was in i explained this to the worker and even showed her the blood blisters on my feet she said there was nothing she could do and did not seem sympathetic at all|0

came in and it was empty should have been a sign to leave but wanted to give it a chance saw the menu and the mains seemed more expensive for the type of feel you get from the restaurant menu is on a piece of paper ordered chicken breast portabello and lamb chops on the menu it says you have choices of sides but the waiter didnt ask us what we wanted the food came out and we both got frozen bagged vegetables and garlic mash potatoes i doubt thats fresh too for 27 dishes i would think they would make the sides fresh lamb chops was pure fat wasnt a great experience since i could have made a chicken breast myself and dump a can of mushroom soup on it i will never return monetary loss|0

after reading the rave reviews here my wife and i decided to try this restaurant today we were initially seated near the front door we felt cold and noticed that other customers were moving themselves to warmer areas yes the heating system needs some work we requested a waitress for a warmer location and were duly obliged however the manager lady was giving us odd looks and appeared annoyed we ticked off the dim sum items in the sheet and handed it off to a waitress had to flag them down as they dont make eye contact and whiz around the waitress took a look at the sheet nodded and went away 10 minutes later the manager approaches us and asks us if we placed an order we said yes and upon asking pointed out the waitress who took our order the manager comes back to us and apologizes for the confusion and then accuses us of not filling in the table this is pre filled in all other dim sum places weve been to she then walks away clutching other sheets which had no tables i hunting down customers beware the sheet doesnt outline the prices so we had no idea how much they cost not impressed at this point we ordered 6 items all pics posted here by me including a snapshot of the bill beef brisket and bok choy in beef broth very good ive never tried this elsewhere and it was actually quite tasty big portion too deep fried pork dumplings 4 small pieces tasted bland didnt like them not warm might have been sitting for a while deep fried squid tentacles bland no spices whatsoever pork puff pastries good but didnt have the flavour infusion present in other dim sum restaurants not warm might have been sitting for a while beef short ribs in maggie sauce good but could have been warmer they forgot to bring us the ith item but we were glad as the other food was below par compared to the likes of sam woo and emerald asking the waiters for things was a chore had to literally wave to them and flag them down didnt expect this from a place which charges 35 for 5 dim sum items one more thing we are of eastern indian persuasion we noticed that a caucasian couple who gave the order 12 hour after us got similar food served first just saying i might give this place one more try in about a couple of months to report back and address the following issues heating bad service atrocious compared to the price meals need to be warmer attitude of management|0

the only interaction i have had with this company is talking with gina on the phone i decided to go with a different company after talking to gina a second time after i asked what day she thought they could come out she rescheduled my appointment to 2 weeks after the original date then she told me i had to have faith in them and be patient and someone would be out she also told me that she was the owner and that she had a bunch of employees quit and that its been really busy there may be thats not the best information to give to prospective clients it just shows that i should not have faith in you and what happens if everyone quits the day before your e scheduled to come out to my home or have confidence in your employees to do the best possible job gina also is rude and has a bad bedside manner go with a different company 05 stars|0

this was our first experience working with a designer and now we will always hire one specifically michelle robertson of changes interior design we bought a 4000 so it house in north scottsdale that we completely remodeled from top to bottom we were feeling overwhelmed with all of the decisions we had to make early on and decided to look into hiring a designer to help us with the process my husband was reluctant at first but once we started working with michelle he quickly agreed that hiring her had been well worth the expense she knew excellent and reasonable contractors helped us to select finishes at all of the best places around the valley and was always available to answer our questions she also had many creative ideas that we never would have thought of on our own michelle not only helped relieve a lot of the stress that always accompanies a major home remodel she understood the vision we had for our dream home and helped us make it a reality once our house was finished and we moved in we hired her once again to help us decorate it and the result was fantastic we always get compliments from visitors and we have referred changes interior design to several of our friends and neighbors michelle is prompt professional reliable and honest she is also energetic and fun after working with her on our house we came to view her as a friend i think that is the case for many of her other former clients as well we truly cant recommend her highly enough if you are thinking about hiring a designer for your home do yourself a favor and choose changes interior design|1
i would give the location 5 stars and the restaurant 3 so were at 4 stars overall i went with hub ski and a couple of friends for a nice weekend picnic the experience would have been a 5 star one if we had brown bagged it but as it was we purchased food from the quaint little house converted to restaurant hub ski and i shared a veggie sandwich and a peach pie thing tasty but most definitely overpriced the iced tea was tasty and refreshing but still sharing a meal with a drink each it should have been less money ill go back for the ambiance its definitely kid and dog friendly but well bring a big blanket some kid toys a dog or three and lunch in a brown bag well still buy pastries though|1
good food greater lunch buffet awesome service too accommodate large parties as well|1

dont even think about renting living here the worst staff i have seen in 15 years may be they dont employee decent well trained and educated people they charge tenants for everything and be have as if they are the landlords and forget that they are just employees there and need to be have respectfully with tenants and listen to the concerns of tenants their lease policies also doesnt align with the market and surrounding areas rental communities at any point of time no matter how many years we live there you are always end up paying 2 months rent as we have to give 45 days notice to vacate and then we need to pay lease break fee if we miss by a day also competitive apartments like chestnut ridge have a better lease terms after we live there for 1 year and more mainly because of the staff and their behaviour worst|0
after visiting a different dentist and basically giving up all hope of being able to afford quality care i remembered previously meeting doctor dave i remembered him to be a really good guy so i figured why not see what he had to offer from the moment i walked in i felt valued not only as a potential client but as a person i explained my needs to doctor dave and he was very understanding i never felt judged for my mostly self imposed dental dilemma or my tight finances he took the time to explain all of my options and even suggested that i break up some of the treatments in order to allow my insurance to better meet my needs i left that day with tears of hope in my eyes they have been my dentist ever since and i am pleased beyond words with the care they have given i went back today and they seemed genuinely glad to see me and again the care was exceptional|1
walked in very rudely asked if i had an appointment i didnt i was signing in my name on the waiting list which you do in any other salon she yells at me not write my name on the list telling me she has no open times i understand that you are busy but dont be rude to a customer she didnt recommend a time to come back and get our nails done she didnt say have a great day which is not mandatory but i mean if you want to have business you would try right|0
nice and friendly owners but their cigar selection is complete junk settled for 6 monte cristo i because out of their entire empty humidor these were the best option they were stale and tasted like knockoffs if your e looking for cigars this isnt the place to go double the price as des down the street and 140th the selection avoid it|0
i have nothing negative to say about the staff that works here however i do not appreciate the owner of the store shane i took my bosses bike in last friday to get a tune up and picked it up on the following monday the first time he rode the back was tuesday morning and while riding something happened with the chain and it popped off and he crashed the bike upon following up with the bike store they were glad to bring it back in and apologized the issue is when i called yesterday afternoon to find out the status shane answered the phone and was short and rude he would not let me explain what happened from point a to where we are now and i never dealt with a shane it was daniel and mark who were helping me the whole time as im trying to explain what happened to my boss shane cut me off and said all i know is you dropped off the bike and said it was okay to be picked up tomorrow and i said excuse me that is not what was said anyways i found out shane is the owner and there isnt a customer service number go figure and i dont even yelp but this was unnecessary and wasted energy i have been in customer service for 15 years and that is not how you treat people a paying customer at that|0
the equipment is decent the price is good push hard for a better deal but watch out for the personal training after being bugged a thousand times to try it i finally got sucked in one day by david he called to confirm my appointment the next day and then asked me to change my time i twisted myself into a pretzel to accommodate and then he didnt show he was actually there but i guess he decided i wasnt worth it i have many examples of this with other folks that had the same thing happen theyre only worried about signing people up watch out if its a gym for 35 month and thats all you need then join here|0
loved our experience at caffe boa my husband and i celebrated our wedding anniversary there on saturday night jerry lynn was our server and she was very knowledgeable about the menu and very friendly and efficient the ambience was awesome music was great we got a table that was secluded from the rest of the main dining area and it was perfect the brush etta appetizer was delicious butternut squash ravioli was to die for they make their own pasta and its so light my husband loved the lasagna and we both agreed the adult stores dessert was the best dessert weve had in a long time loved loved loved our experience highly recommend it for couples on date night|1

the food is pretty good compared to the other locations the only thing is the qua i is old and taste like a mushy banana in my bus exact words now thats all i taste when i eat it but otherwise its not bad the 2 stars is for the awful service drive thru takes forever no matter what time of day i finally went inside to see if it was any different its just as bad or worse it was a little quicker but the two ladies one was wearing a choker and earrings which im pretty sure is not allowed when handling food the other was the manager anyways i was not greeted i walked up and made eye contact with the girl in the choker and she literally looked at me and walked away then went to her manager they talked for like a minute and she came back and just said are you ready i ordered my food and waited a minute later the manager acknowledges me and just asks if i needed something|0

i do not recommend this storage facility i rented a unit from them to store some things while i was out of town on business while i was away they had a huge fire and all of my belongings were damaged thousands of dollars worth of my property renters insurance only covers 10 was now worthless the owner scott garth and his staff did very little to try to accommodate anybody who had major damage to their property they instead worked harder at trying to weasel their way out of being liable for anybody elses belongings they run a shady business over there and i strongly suggest you look elsewhere for an establishment thats ran legit|0

i love going to this festival we stumbled upon it on accident when biking around toronto and i am glad we did first off this really should be called hot sauce fest or the king of condiments fest because to be honest the food aspect of the festival is pretty week so why they high rating i love hot sauce at any given time i have between 10 and 15 flavors in my fridge and more in the cupboard ohio has a great festival at jungle jims and the national fiery foods barbecue show in new mexico is like the hot sauce super bowl this is the closest option to me buffalo for small batch craft sauces there are literally hundreds of sauces here most of which are reasonably priced in addition to hot sauce you can get a variety or biq spices salsa mustards jams etc the variety and originality of some of the sauces are great the location is right on the waterfront which is always nice give it a shot and you will be impressed if you keep in mind that it should be renamed to better reflect the products offered|1

extremely disappointed the unit was delivered damaged and dirty the pack rat unit sign was torn at the rivers and bent in half the exposed river holes allowed for debris and moisture to enter the unit the driver claimed he had delivered damaged units before and that everything would be okay not a good business model especially considering the price i had to sweep leftover christmas tree bristles and garland out of the unit i had to do a hodgepodge repair to the massive tear and holes on the sides of the unit by filling the spaces exposed to the elements with a weather prodding putty that is similar to play doe also i was told to clear two parking spaces in my apartment complex but the driver took up four spaces and parked the unit at a ridiculous angle luckily there were open spaces in my neighborhood or i dont know what my family would have done i have a class i cal and seriously could have backed the unit i myself i called the 1800packrat number to report the terrible condition that the unit was in and they had no solution but offered to send another unit the next day which would ruin my moving schedule i booked professional movers with another company so in summary my belongings are traveling across country for 10 business days in the only unit pack rat had available and did not bother to repair a damaged container i would compare pack rat to the pod and haul u box storage units but i have seen a pod and u box delivered and both were more easily maneuverable whereas mummy pack rat unit was maneuvered like a clunky dumpster i am so frustrated that i will stop my review here pictures posted|0

i grew up eating costco poutine in the food court while trying to find which cashier my mom was at but my friend told me i had to try some real poutine and so here we are first of all location its easy to find and conveniently next to square one but theres no free parking around unless your e willing to walk like 10 minutes its okay if you have someone with you and can drop them off to quickly buy go but if your e alone its a pain plaza is pretty new so everything is clean and spacious and modern the actual poutine i found good but not mindblowing ly fantastic enough to deserve the 15 price tag we ordered the normal poutine i like keeping it og at first try the best thing was the texture the fries and cheese curds are super chewy portion size we up sized is solid definitely enough for 2 people but there isnt enough gravy and near the end of the poutine experience we ran out of cheese the gravy was good subtle and richer in flavour instead of the super artificial type gravy ive had elsewhere all in all its a solid poutine good cheese good fries and okay gravy the flavours go together well but since its nothing insanely good or new in my opinion its not really worth the high price|0

as a polish citizen trying introduce locals to polish food i was very disappointed food quality was ok but service was terrible i am pretty sure that it would by hard to find such a rude staff in the entire poland nowadays we were picking up an order to go thank god that we decided to do that instead dining in once we were making sure everything was ok order for 6 people we were attacked by two ladys one of them supposedly chef pretty much they told us to pay and get the hell out of there just like i said we were just checking out boxes and come ring a list with boxes standing on the side sad but true so much for polish community in ohio|0
wow do not go here whatsoever i called earlier today to book an appointment and a gentleman helped me and said he put me with a male masseur i left work early to get here and early enough to fill out their paperwork on their i pad a total of 18 and 11 in uber to get here after i fill out questions and concerns a woman comes out to take me in the back and i find out shes my massage therapist and not the male masseur i was booked with she asked me how can i help you i told her i was riding my bike and had a minor little crash and fell on the pavement 3 days prior explained nothing was broken i am just sore from my accident she starts freaking out and basically says she cant help me which doesnt make sense at all then we have to go out to the front room and both attendants are busy after a moment she starts telling a gentleman whos checking someone out the story and then i start explaining to the the girl attendant after her client left whats going on the attendant literally explains that theyre fully booked and they have no one that can take me and said sorry about that in a very i really dont give a ok kind of tone lao there was no lets figure out how to fix this situation and make it better there couldve been many options and none of them were met not even offered i shouldve never said anything about my bicycle accident to masseur in the first place secondly they put me with the wrong massage therapist anyway what if i said nothing she wouldve massaged me and honestly athletes deal with massive major injuries and id rather deal with a professional and seasoned massage therapist that knows what theyre doing not these cockamamie jokers employed at this place absurd the level of un professionalism from the female massage therapist and the girl attendant behind the counter was just jaw dropping they seemed to be completely on different levels the way business is handled and communication is done is really snotty its also really hurting the business i shouldve checked the reviews before i came here looks like three stars and will only get worse because i will not be back|0

edit after owner response during one of our calls the ord call i believe with the restaurant we specifically asked if the issue was with the restaurant or with uber eats your employee said that it was the restaurants problem because of the other large orders please do not try to put the blame on uber eats we did not receive a call from tasty grill until almost an hour after we had ordered a call that should have been made immediately so we could have cancelled our order the people we spoke with on the phone kept saying 20 more minutes even though it ended up taking another hour and a half|0

my family and i have been getting take out from here for years my husband went to pick up the food and offered us a 5 percent discount this has never happen before we get our food home go to eat and it doesnt taste the same as we always get i ordered the chicken fried noodles and get chicken with beef and veggies and not only is the order wrong bit all of our food is not the same i call to asks if they are under new ownership mind you they have closed a few times for whatever discrepancies but they re rude and the normal women who was there answering the phones they tell us she retired yeah no they are definitely different and overpriced for the crap food we got will not ever go again beware all regulars they have changed no matter how much they lie|0

was hoping for this to be a welcome addition to a sad lack of casual dining choices in the pickering area but alas it was disappointing the restaurant itself has about 10 tables if you wanted to dine in but it is still counter ordering and pick up the main options are philly cheesesteaks pulled pork and poutine we ordered a phil thy poutine which refers to the size not the toppings a pulled pork a cheesesteak and a peppercorn steak sandwich there are many poutine varieties the staff were pleasant and helpful to explain options but it was pretty dead in the restaurant so not sure what it would be when busy suggestions for sauces and cheeses were made order to exit took about 10 mins the food looked yummy coming out the poutine especially was ginormous gleaming with gravy and cheese curds but overall looks were deceiving the poutine was seriously lacking in gravy only the fries on top had any this is a huge pet peeve of mine if i wanted plain fries id order plain fries all three sandwiches were meh my pulled pork wouldnt stay in he bun the sa uci ness of it just disintegrated the bun it also had a very mushy texture also the hostess gave me grief about wanting to put coleslaw which they offered as a condiment on my sandwich she said you know this is cold and the sandwich is hot right um yeah but hello classic pairing the other 2 sandwiches had same bun issues big portions underwhelming flavour disappointing construction i wont be returning|0
only went there because our builder gets their cabinets and countertops from them and i wanted a cabinet for our bathroom and cabinets for our laundry room that matched existing cabinets they have only one person jeff who works in cabinets and if hes not there no one knows anything waited well beyond date promised cabinet in bath cane with no shelves and in the with hour was told they had no remnants to sell me for the countertop for the laundry sink after he repeatedly told me no problem this company is poorly run and should either work solely in wholesale with builders and forget retail customers altogether or vice versa did i mention i had to pay everything up front when ordered never again i am a realtor and will never recommend this company|0

came here to celebrate my husbands birthday last night its unfortunate that some reviews online had me questioning whether we should go here at all but thankfully my husband said he wanted to try it out given that it was so close to home this is the sweetest little restaurant very cozy and filled to the brim with french posters from art galleries etc loved the black and white tiled flooring everything else about it was charming if you are a fan of privacy id recommend making a reservation and asking for a secluded table as there were a few scattered around the restaurant otherwise the tables are placed rather close together we came early enough so it wasnt too busy and what i did like was that they spaced people out around the restaurant so that you werent seated next to anyone until they absolutely had to our waitress was very pleasant and helpful regarding what to order for the wine we shared a cheap half litre of merlot the one thing that always gets me at restaurants is how much the wine is marked up their cabernet special of the day was 30 for a half litre while it was delicious we tried it before we made up our minds im glad we didnt end up ordering it as a quick google search told me one bottle went for 14 this isnt specific to this one restaurant as all restaurants do this but if your e not looking to be wowed by your wine the cheapest option usually does the trick for the appetizer we split the onion tart and the escargot the onion tart was creamy melt in your mouth heaven the escargot wasnt the best ive had and the puff pastry was a bit soggy at the bottom but i do tend to enjoy it more when drowned in butter and garlic next time i will ask if this is an option if not i think i would pass on the escargot for dinner we got the trio of sausages the lamb loin ordered medium we loved the sausages paired with the dijon mustard which was a whipped delight each one had its own flavour and for two meat lovers you cant really get any better than a plate of sausages the lamb was one of the best ive had cooked to perfection it was very tender and melted in my mouth each dish is paired with a nice serving of veggies and we were both stuffed to the brim once we finished our meals for dessert we shared the chocolate mousse which was delectable i wanted to lick the bowl clean it did have orange zest in it though which you could taste so if your e not a fan of orangey chocolate id pass on this one price wise this place is a steal you get a lot of food and for 122 we had a 12 litre of wine two appetizers two main courses and shared a dessert definitely worth checking out we will return|1
expect a long wait i waited about 2 hours just to be seen bring a book or laptop or sleeping bag the waiting room was full of people who were restless a few even sleeping because they i been waiting for so long also when standing at the window to ask a question it seems they purposely turn their backs or heads so as not to appear to see you so they dont have to acknowledge you 4 people milling about the office and over 7 minutes for them to acknowledge me standing there only good thing is parking is easy and convenient|0
i just noticed this place when our hell dorado days float went by it during the parade a few days later i checked it out it was pretty good i would say 35 stars the beef paying curry was very good the chicken satay was good but i didnt like the la rob i love la rob but theirs was a little gritty i assume from the spices in it i am happy to find another good place to eat for when i am downtown this place isnt good enough as a destination thai restaurant for me id rather go to thai biq or lotus of siam but it is a happy downtown find i will go back again they do delivery also|1

i usually leave really positive reviews but the sushi was awful especially for a place that charges 26 for their weekend sushi was expecting much better quality firstly the ay ce menu on the i pads dont have descriptions so you dont know what your e ordering they double up the rice in each roll you can see it they roll it twice they load up each roll with sauces one looked like they poured mango juice on top could barely taste the fish the only good things really were the ice cream and dumplings do not spend money here for ay ce|0

our entire family decided on attending this restaurant for fathers day as wed heard that the food was really good and that there was mariachi playing on the weekend this establishment disappointed in every way possible indeed the mariachi and banda played while we were there but it was ridiculously loud ive eaten at plenty of restaurants where a mariachi plays but you are always able to have your meal and even converse unless the band is right at your table here they were playing so loud that even the waitress couldnt make out your order six inches away from you we could have gotten past the blaring music if the service or food would have made up for it but lamentably they both fell very short of an acceptable level our waitress had an attitude that made it seem as if we were lucky to even receive service i am mexican and grew up in this type of establishment so there is no misunderstanding of cultural norms here the waitress was plain and simply rude and made a point of not demonstrating competence once the food was brought to the table almost an hour later 6 out of 10 plates were incorrect probably due to not being able to hear the order correctly over the music we let our waitress know of the mistake but chose to keep the plates so as to not have to wait another hour her response was that we should have been louder when we ordered in the end the food was lackluster and comparable to what you would be able to get at any drive thru mexican restaurant here in phoenix in summary i understand that fathers day is a busy time but as a restaurant owner you have to be able to anticipate this and train your staff on dealing with large numbers of patrons additionally if your own staff cant hear your customers orders you could easily turn down your sound system just seems like common sense ambiance frustrating service deplorable food forgettable|0

so we usually love texas road house staple location but we came to this one because we were in area it started ok because we went on a friday night which usually means long wait times but they had us seated in about ten minutes then when our server came thats when it started to go down hill she really didnt engage us it was just what do you want and i will get it attitude well we all ordered and my father was with us he ordered the half chicken they came back 510 minutes later to tell him they did not have any chickens so on a friday night how do you run out of something it was not even late we ordered around 700 so then my dad asked to order a burger cooked medium she said that she couldnt do that its against company policy i am sorry but you are a steak house you cook steaks rare and you just told him his first choice he can not have and now he can not have his burger cooked how he enjoys the food came and wasnt the best we have ad there my wife couldnt finish her dish which was a biq pork plate she may have eaten a 14 of it if i were a server that would prompt me to aks if it was ok but no i had the country fried sirloin the meat tasted ok but the gravy seemed to have may be three times the normal salt put into it also when she served my baked sweet potato the plate seemed to be on fire she said it was warm no this plate was fricken hot and my hand stung the rest of the night the server asked how the table was once we didnt answer and she moved on so yes i will not be going to this location for a while|0

its hard to review this place because in some aspects its awesome and in some its terrible awesome so many menu items and every day is a different deal lets not forget half off apps mon fri 36 free party room rental in the back i had an event there with adults and young ones and it was the perfect space to let them run around a bit without interrupting anyone different beer sizes make for a fun beer sampling experience lots of comfy seating just watch out for the windows the winter air can leak in and freeze you trivia on the to terrible service while most staff are very nice many tend to be forgetful or slow its not bad enough to warrant a bad tip but enough that you need to be proactive with waving the staff member over to remember you especially for water refills forgetful cooks the food is pretty good but theres been a few occasions where the kitchen forgets to plate all the items ive ordered|1

i have not dined out for new year in a very long time we chose hamiltons for an intimate early dinner knowing later would be crowed it was nice there were only 4 other couples and a few people at the bar the new years menu for 95 was a surprise not mentioned when reservations made the service was outstanding food good not great the price was outrageous considering the bite size portions where they failed once the bill was paid we were asked to finish our wine at the bar we questioned why we needed to prepare for the next seating the tables were empty and may be 15 people at the bar i was in food serve for many years i dine out 34 times a week never been asked to move to the bar not the best experience deal breaker|0
iv been to this ufc 3 times in the last year each time i went i had the worst ufc experience iv ever had in my entire life i was going to write out the whole story but theyve already wasted too much of my time so ill keep it as short as possible the fact that the only 3 times iv been there were the worst is an anomaly but not a coincidence they dont like their jobs and they dont care the ord and last time i went me and a person before me were standing at the register for 10 minutes before someone came to even take our order i just walked out and left because thats how it is every time and then you wait 20 to 30 minutes and your food looks like they stabbed your chicken with the tongs a couple of times or whatever they used to pick it up didnt fill my cup thing up with the corn it was outstandingly disrespectful i can see the drive thru getting served while im there but i have a work truck so i have to go inside the lady working at the drive thru always looks mad then waits 10 minutes before she makes someone from the back come and take our order and when they come they look like they hate us for making them have to work its not right|0

it was a bad experience too bad you can not rate the service food and ambiance differently friday may with i purchased a 2500 restaurant com gift card for roma garden the conditions did not specify a black out day they did stipulate we spend a minimum of 4750 we decided to use it that night we arrived and were seated by a nicely dressed hostess there was live music playing ambiance rating 4 star a cute old italian man singing and playing piano it was entertaining for my 4 year old our server was a pleasant young blond she wasnt very informative though prior to ordering our drinks i presented her with our gift card and was told no problem no problem there was an older man server who was offering his tables free appetizers and desserts we didnt even get the complimentary bread we ordered based on the 4750 surely my 4 yr old didnt need an entire portion of spaghetti and meatballs they do not have a childs portion my husband and kiddo each had the spaghetti and meatballs i opted for the spinach cheese ravioli which tasted like the frozen ravioli from costco food i would rate 3 stars i saved room for creme brulee my favorite we ordered dessert even though other tables were receiving it for free the creme brulee was served ice cold as if it had all including the brulee i crust had been prepared ahead of time the creme tasted like a pudding rather than a rich custard finally time to pay our bill the owner approached our table and informed us that they would not be honoring restaurant com gift card as it was their grand opening i politely explained to her i presented this gift card prior to even ordering drinks and that we left it on the table throughout our meal and never once had anyone told us it wouldnt be honored and i would have ordered differently not spending 4950 had i known they werent going to honor their gift card we politely paid the tab and left i will not ever go back there i am instead going to see if restaurant com will allow me to switch for another restaurant a note to the owners do not offer gift cards and promotions if you have no intent to honor them i feel like we were given the bait and switch|0

just want to warn everyone if you are moving and have to inform max of your new change of address be very sure that they have it and that they do send your utility bill to your new address so that you can pay it before the due date comes along i moved and gave them my new billing address at the max counter at city hall this was way before the calgary floods so no excuse there when i realized that i hadnt received a bill in the mail for a little over a month i asked them why they told me they didnt have my new billing address because they claim i never gave it to them i told them i did and signed a change of address form with them as well i even have a copy of the form to proof it but they maintained i never gave it to them at that time after looking into this further turns out someone at the max counter at city hall never processed my new billing address and when i got it sorted a bill finally came i owed a huge amount on it i was very angry its a mystery to me as to why they didnt just mail a bill even if it went to my old address because i had given canada post my new change of address a few months before and i have received all my bills with no problems how can a company that i have an account with for so many years over look this kind of discrepancy why didnt they keep on top of this and inform me of the problem they have my phone number and they didnt bother to call not even to leave a message on my machine i never got an apology for their oversight this is a problem if this has happened to other customers as this means someone is not doing their job properly its hard and unexpected budget wise to be slapped with a big bill and have so little time to pay it max says that they have a repayment program but that just means that you have to pay more the following month as a new bill comes in so that you can never get ahead of it if you dont pay the whole amount right away i know you may say that this doesnt occur often and perhaps it doesnt but when you are on a tight budget as i am and this happens its a big setback financially bottom line make sure they actually do what they say theyll do and keep on top of it and that goes for all your other bills as well thanks for listening mary i|0
i dont understand why there arent more reviews on this excellent indian fast food i came across this place by accident and decided to try it out being a fan of indian food even though the mall les faubourg i looks sketchy dont be fooled this might be the best quality food you can have for the price you will pay we ordered two full plates that included salads rice and potatoes one plate was a mix of vegetarian curries and the other one was butter chicken one naan bread for us it was made right on the spot in an authentic tandoori oven and one samosa the total was of 20 i was very skeptical but once i had my first bite i knew i had to come back for more the food wasnt too spicy but you had the choice to add very spicy sauce if you are a fan of hot food the food and sauces were fresh and the naan is hands down the best i have ever had no kidding in conclusion if you are looking for fast indian food for a good price you need to try this out|1

so is johnny mcguire i closed or is it not i guess ill have to cruise by and check it out for myself ive tasted their fine sandwiches but not in house they sent out a food truck to first friday this past weekend may be i was in the wrong area but the amount and quality of food vendors at of was a little disappointing fortunately my group stumbled upon the johnny i acquires truck i was he distant at first the menu looked like a solid deli but you never can tell especially when stuff is being prep i on a truck i waited for my wife and a few others to order so i could get a look and steal a bite it only took one bite of the 220b for me to decide i was in i went with the olympian myself and have to say it was one of the best sandwiches ive had in a while the price is portion ration was fine i thought considering other options were deep friend this or that for the same price around the way the bread was soft and fresh cheese gooey and the corned beer and pastrami was not too fatty the only bad part about the sandwich is that after eating it i wanted to just curl up into a ball and take a nap my wife loved her 220b and if the non mobile location is still open i think we will be paying them a visit very soon side note the chips were hit or miss i didnt order them but some were crunchy and some were very soggy not sure if this was a product of being made on the truck or what either way they were fresh and the crunchy ones were good|1
this place is a bit of an institution and i usually come here when i have a poutine craving the poutine here and at the ban qui se are quite similar and both are excellent but my preference for chez claudette is due to shorter lineups and they accept credit cards i think ban qui se might have a bit more selection in the type of poutine i but chez claudette has quite a variety in selection so there is bound to be something for everybodys taste|1

these clowns make the dev seem like an appealing option and in the end i had to go to the dev anyway because they were unable to service my registration i looked them up on the map and called them to ask if they could do smog rego plus accept my veterans exemption they said no problem they could handle it when i arrived at the location on my map they were nowhere to be found so i called them and they said they were in a new location when they gave me the intersection i asked which corner northwest southwest etc and the clerk wasnt even able to answer that they were polite but pretty much useless for using an exemption i your registration on the plus side why they even got a single star from me the smog check was pretty smooth and painless and only 20 edit ended up using the kiosk in robertsons just down the road 5 cheaper and no wait for registration sticker dev drop makes you wait a week or pay 50 for immediate delivery|0

one of the worst experiences ive had with a company in phoenix let me lay out the scenario and the opportunities they had to make it right yet refused i posted an ad on craig list to get 1 palm tree trimmed and skinned very basic stuff got a ton of people wanting to do the work range from 5075 for most to complete the work my girlfriend convinced me to pick someone that was licence i bonded these guys replied back to me have a website seem like they knew what they were doing so i decided to pay for the highest bid of 80 and get landscape doctors to show up guy showed up while i was getting ready for work said what needed to be done and what was agreed he only wanted to trim the top reminded him what the deal was and left a check i get home only the top is trimmed nothing skinned i can trip the top myself and have done the previous 7 years i just wanted someone to skin the tree he leaves the job incomplete obviously takes the check i reply back to the email and get a phone call from a lady seemed to be an owner she promised to make it right and call be to reschedule someone else to come out of course that never happened and when i saw the check deposited a few days later i knew i was screwed this year rolls around and i figure why not give them one more shot to make it right so i send them another follow up email offer them to chance to make it right and complete the work that was promised and paid for that email was sent 2 weeks ago no response they had every chance to make it right and chose not to do not do business with this company if you want quality work done at a competitive price if you prefer false promises and excessive pricing these people are right for you|0
after our existing garage door opener quit suddenly on a friday afternoon i started to research options for a company to replace the door after looking at a few different rating sites including yelp i came across arizona i garage door doctor i called on late friday afternoon and was able to get an appointment scheduled for sunday between noon and 2 i was amazed at all the 5 start ratings but after having my garage door opener replaced this sunday afternoon i totally agree with all the 5 star ratings i received a call from the technician about 1130 telling me he might be a few minutes early if that was ok with me when he arrived he walked me through what he was going to do looked at our existing door and pointed out potential areas that might need work in the future in a professional manner without up selling me on other services he was efficient and put in our new opener in about an hour in the end the price that i was charged was exactly what i was quoted on the phone when i scheduled the appointment if you need someone to replace your garage door opener look no further than arizona garage door doctor|1
this place is great if i cant schedule a doctors app pint ment and dont want to spend hours in the hospital i go here i am always in and out quickly i have gone there multiple times for different things and the doctors have helped me out a lot every time keep in mind this place is an urgent care and a small place so they dont have all the highly advanced equipment a hospital would have i would check their website or call if you are unsure if they are able to treat you they do walk ins and scheduled appointments|1
i took my i phone 6 screen totally broken i didnt think it could be fixed i always thought cell phone shops to be shady but jesus was honest even told me if it wasnt fixed no charge he was able to fix it within 45 min even saved all my pictures and the messages i missed while broken i am extremely happy with his service saved me a lot of money in purchasing a new phone definitely recommend this biz thank you|1
absolutely horrible i showed him a photo for reference to the type of style i wanted but stated i wanted blonde chunks in the bottom and wanted the length to be long enough that i could still pull it back he put what could barley pass for blonde highlights in the top of my my head that were about 45 strands of hair each and are not even visible unless you literally pick through the hair with your fingers last time i checked that doesnt qualify as chunks i was told that after washing my hair they would pop and be really visible not even close its been 3 days and i still cant find them next he cut the top of my hair so short that it cant even be pinned back let alone tied back so instead of a shag i left with a mullet i left with a massive headache from my head being tossed around and yanked during cut and wash and was forced to even abide to the awkward hug he imposed on me i had to pay 400 for hair extensions to fix the mess he made of my hair and when i went back to get a refund i was told he doesnt return money agreed that he didnt do what i wanted as he misunderstood me yet still refused even a partial return yelled at me to get out amongst other rude behaviour all while a customer was seated in his chair when i told him he needs to rectify the problem or i will take him to court he told me ill be waiting and to get in line seriously that many people have complained about your service that you have a line up of court cases|0
this is simply to note that we have no review since the place is closed|0
i am of native american decent i currently reside in tempe and ive made three visits to this hospital for a to test screening and an emergency situation all of my visits were very pleasing the staff definitely deals with lots of in and outpatients but also provides compassionate care if you treat them with the utmost respect the level of care that was provided was excellent especially for a federally funded organization it is crucial if you plan on making a trip to the express care is to definitely call and check if they have exceeded the amount of admitted patients otherwise youll come down and they will have a sign stating that you will have to return the next day|1

there are many reasons fou is will always hold a special spot in my heart but ill break it down to three main points 1 a montreal institution with a wicked history of live performances 2 an absolutely huge space complete with rotating decor a large patio pool tables foosball projector screens to watch the game and a stage and dance floor upstairs where you can rage with the hardcore kids or get your white girl on depending on the night 3 stupid cheap drink specials ive seen 6 pitchers 1 bottles 2 mixed drinks the list goes on regardless of the night you go you can pretty well bank on getting wasted on the cheap ive had countless nights and afternoons at fou is over the years and have yet to walk away from this place without a good story is this the same fou is of decades past absolutely not but this is as good a dive bar as youll ever find and has long since earned its place in montreal music history|1

i know im gonna sound like a oxymoron but im not religious yet i am a god fearing person i bring this up because while searching for a right school dojo for my oldest son i was a bit hesitant about a stranger pushing their beliefs on to him i could not have been more wrong i love the fact that sensei has the right balance he teaches you that it starts with you also not to state the obvious there is a god before coming here my son was all over the place and had some bulling issues with the help of teachers and sensei smith and his school my son seems more in tuned with himself he knows he can only control his actions i highly recommend this school etiquette respect control coordination all comes with practice it is the understanding of purpose of your training and the sincerity to train with good attitude and intention that sets us apart from other places sensei smith well said thank you|1

a joe and his team are as good as it gets many people are wary of calling a to i service especially an offload oriented to i service for fear of gouging fear not with arizona ex off road recovery they will come get you however thick your situation may be and do so safely and ethically best in class for sure i am in a well known jeep club and have personally seen the arizona ex off road recovery team at work in sticky situations up at sunflower mine in florence junction and at table mesa they have capable vehicles and capable professional people with a lot of years experience in this profession if youve found this review because your e looking for help give them a call you wont be disappointed also of note i had some trouble with another to i service with a very similar name to this one rescue or something like that instead of recovery turns out those guys with rescue are pretty new to the scene will attempt to impersonate az ex off road recovery on the phone and will gouge you when your e most vulnerable i was wheeling my jeep once here in arizona and i came across that other rescue company pulling a pickup truck off some rocks in a very easy section of a trail had to stop behind them because they were taking up the whole trail when we got out and went up to see if we could help we saw that they were professionally filming the extraction in talking to a couple of the people in their group they said they had staged the whole thing that the truck was not really stuck and that they were filming it for a video on their website these people with rescue couldnt even video real recoveries to put on their website if you call ask for joe specifically scott|1
this is a tough review to write on the one hand their cook is incredible hes nice remembers your order and makes one of the best breakfast burritos in town i would highly recommend getting the bacon one and adding jalapeno i also if you go there for lunch and get one of their specials it is very generic a cafeteria food of the items served on their specials typically one is pretty good one is really bad to the point you cant eat it and one is mediocre while the food passes the test for cheap quick food what kills this place in the ratings is the cashiers ability to be unfriendly almost all of the time if you go there just once or twice you wouldnt even notice it but if you go there most days of the week for breakfast it starts to ruin the great breakfast burrito ill still eat here but if anyone recommends anywhere else count me in|0

this is the worst company i have ever dealt with i placed an order for turf almost two months ago they advertise that they ship your order out the very same day you place it i was told my order would arrive 14 to 21 days later i was saddened that my three boys would have to wait that long to finally have a yard following our conversion from natural grass to turf but understood the limitations of shipping something so bulky and heavy that distance my card was immediately charged about 600000 it was to be delivered to my home instead my order was sent to a receiving warehouse where someone else signed for and took it it took countless calls to get morningstar turf to even research this happening let alone begin to rectify the situation i didnt even learn about the shipping error for a week and a half after it happened and only because i relentlessly pestered them during this time the broken record response i got when i could get one was oh just wait another couple of days im sure youll get it again i was getting this reply even during the entire week and a half after my order had been shipped to the wrong place and taken by someone else i finally called three times in one hour demanding to speak with the owner the owner marc morningstar finally returned my call but made nothing but excuses took no responsibility and refused to let me cancel the order and give me a refund claiming that a new order had already been shipped now they are again giving me the run around as to my orders whereabouts by telling me someone from their logistics department will look into it and contact me they never do and even though nearly another two weeks has past since assuring me that the new order was on the truck en route they are yet to even give me a simple tracking number i am starting to fear i am the victim of fraud my kids have nothing but compacted crushed rock to play on where a lush lawn should be now the seattle weather has turned back to the usual 7 consecutive months of rain and the kids are cooped up in the house due to weather i feel helpless because i live in wa state and morningstar is based in phoenix what ever you do dont do business with this company and warn anyone you know considering installing synthetic turf morningstar turf is at best totally incompetent and absent any form of accountability and at worst just plain criminal jason federal way wa update i got a representative to answer the phone when he again tried to pass the buck to the logistics department and i got angry at the prospect of more run around i said i was going to report them to the bob his reply was go for it we are not a member of the bob when i looked them up on the bob i found they had a i rating with specific complaints that sounded eerily similar to my own experience the bob eventually closed multiple complaints due to failure to respond by morningstar turf as the phone call ended the morningstar representative sarcastically said good luck with that bob complaint shame on them shame on me for not doing my research before ordering from this horrid company do your homework look them up on the bob dont make the mistake i did update this the the exact email i sent to the owner of morningstar turf i will post here if it accomplishes anything marc just in case you do have concern for your companys reputation here is a review i posted about my morningstar turf experience httpwww yelp com biz morningstar turf florence i am through hounding your company for updates as to my orders whereabouts only to be told every time that someone in another department will contact me with that info the logistics department idea is very clever it gets your initial point of contact person off the phone with the frustrated client and then logistics doesnt bother to follow up with that client i believe its called passing the buck very clever like i said i am done pursuing you every day that goes by that i dont get that elusive call from your logistics department i am going to find another site to post this exact review this was to days post on yelp com tomorrow i plan to become a member of angles list and continue spreading this scathing yet factually accurate review of your miss managed company like the plague when i run out of web sites to post reviews on i will be calling visa to report a fraud and have the charges to my card reversed just thought you should know jason|0
good morning thats the first thing you i like to hear when you come downstairs after a great night of sleep we walked down this morning at approximately 932 am and the staff behind the desk were so engulfed in their personal conversation that we couldnt even get a good morning im an spy member and i stay at four points shelton often when i travel while i love this chain this particular location left me with a sour taste in my mouth it doesnt matter how huge you are how nice your rooms are if customer service is lacking you may as well close your doors and go home for the day my rating of a two is because i will never choose this location again|0

i bought a voucher for two 60 minute massage from team buy first problem was that no matter how many emails you send to the email address on the voucher there is no response finally i complained to team buy and asked for a refund at the same time i found their phone number and called them the schedule was bad they were booked for most of the times that could make it and i had to book my two sessions before the expiration date anyways the receptionist is also very rude and not helpful at all she wouldnt let me in for my second session although my name and voucher number were in their database she needed to see a print out which i didnt have for my and session the therapists were both good they both spend some time on checking my health which to me sounded redundant and reduced the actual massage time however the deal was inexpensive so you get service as much as you pay i guess|0

other than location they need improve in several areas cheap sheets that wont stay on the bed so very uncomfortable i had to use the blanket and a towel to make it work they need to invest in making a comfortable bed shampoo conditioner gel too small barely enough for one use also the spa and restaurant are closed for renovations no notice of this on websites or even in the room into pool looked nice but we didnt use it valentines weekend we paid 179 a night i fell that was overpriced wont be staying there again unless the greatly improve the beds and toiletries|0

quick word of advice do not go here we walk into the restaurant with no greeting so we seat ourselves we waited ten minutes before someone noticed us shouldve taken this as a warning we kept it simple with salad cheese bread and calzones good to go not quite too difficult fifteen minutes later and we still havent received our salad the server whitney walks by stops looks at my boyfriend with a confused look on her face then looks down at her order tab then scurries off about five minutes later she comes back to let us know that the computer ate our order and she needs to retake it and this shouldve been our second clue yet another fifteen minutes later we finally received our salad fifteen minutes for a caesar salad its not that complicated the cheese bread comes out a few minutes later by this point we had already been there an hour and we still hadnt gotten our main course the families who arrived when we put in our order for a second time had already eaten and paid their check finally the damn calzones arrive for this long wait i expected them to be amazing wrong worst calzone i have ever had the outside was burnt this inside was barely warm i had about five bites just because we waited so damn long for this calzone and i was starving the last bite i could hardly keep down so the server comes back with the bill she didnt take off a penny no free dessert nothing i admit we shouldve said something about getting at least the 400 side salad off but i was afraid of what i might say to this girl i just wanted to get the hell out of there because we were now running late for the rest of the evenings plans i honestly have never not tipped a server in my life but i happily did so that evening absolutely nothing still hungry on our way home we stopped at jack in the box this fast food joint operated and tasted like a five star restaurant compared to this place roto los i have never experienced a meal like this i have had good service paired with alright food bad service with amazing food but never horrible service with horrible food take my advice please do not go here you will be incredibly disappointed|0
our condominiums recently changed their management to greenway i am not sure if the snide attitude and couldnt care less demeanor are just typical for the coordinators of these programs or whether these types are actively searched out for these positions however the discussion i had with larry who was supposed to be helping me was quite disrespectful these guys are quick to contact if anything goes wrong our end but slow and ineffective should they be required to live up to their responsibilities|0
best experience for my first time i so recommend this place oh boy how good i feel i got a relaxation massage with the raindrop from kiera she made me feel so relaxed i am definitely coming back|1
do not move here they issued parking passes and my friends came over and their car was towed they have visitor parking but all the spots were filled up that night so they parked in a spot beside a visitor parking space later that night morning when they went to leave around am their car had been towed we went to the office when they opened with this information to explain all the spots were filled and they could have cared less the office manager also refused to refund the 20000 that it cost my friends to get their car back after this event took place my friends never come over now we have to meet else where|0
i love how convenient it is to buy pastries near my home the owner there is always so welcoming and kind and he always makes me want to go back i totally recommend this place|1
great variety of premium juices to smell no testers prices seem a bit high compared to other vapor shops however i have to admit their juices are top notch i also have to ask this guy for a veteran discount every time you i think he would know me by now after all my spending cant keep the high demand juices in stock better off getting from the seller direct they ship next day|0
probably couldnt have been a worse experience in terms of renovating if you care about quality of workmanship at all do not use floor one took 3 weeks to complete a 1409 square foot job and there are still things that look terrible but i just couldnt take it anymore there was zero attention to detail im not sure if it depends on the crew you get but my crew seems to have no professional training every time something went wrong they offered to fix it and then it would just come out worse or a new problem would arise after spending upwards of 10000 on materials and labor this looks like something i could have done better myself i am most disappointed in the complete laziness and the fact that the workers were okay leaving a job looking like this and feeling proud of it there were discounts given only in terms of things that were their fault broken fridge dents put in brand new walls garage door hit there was no discount or even offer for the poor level of workmanship that should definitely not command top dollar run|0
avoid this company they replaced windshields for both of my cars and tried to leave both jobs hastily trash was left around rear view window wasnt reconnected properly and not all the stabbing was pushed in properly but none of that was my major problem with the company mike was the man who came to my door to pitch me the sale and he gave me his number and told me to call for any issues he told me they would throw in a free tint strip and that they would run it 5 inches down to match my height when i received the replacement window the strip was about 10 inches which makes it difficult to see through at night i have to hunch down to see through the clear part of my windshield also on the tint is a huge area of unpleasant bubbling on the driver side the strip is obviously aftermarket and was not applied by a professional i have called mike multiple times and he has apologized and promised me that he would get me in touch with his tint guy but i never received a call back now mike just ignores my phone calls it doesnt even go to voice mail it gets answered and then hung up on before i have a chance to say anything dont do business with this company unless you want poor craftsmanship and poor customer service update barely 3 months after the install the windshield is completely cracked in half the bubbling on the window tint has gotten much worse mike still doesnt answer my calls|0
horrible experience and will do everything in my power to not recommend this place to anyone new channel 12 was even on my side about this they sold me a lemon less than a year ago and its falling apart on me they lied and said it was in great condition and charged me 11000 for a fair condition car that i ended up later finding out it was only worth 6000 at the time the car i went there to look at had mysteriously been sold the hour prior and they talked me into this car when i didnt even want an automatic but offered to lower the price which they never ended up doing so now i am stuck with this 2006 pos car that is literally falling apart left and right to the point to where the door wont even close now i went back to speak with them and all 3 men laughed in me and my moms face they need to learn how to have better customer service and how to treat women|0

better prices than other places ive looked good selection of used mountain and road bikes and the bikes are all ready to ride definitely not your typical snooty hipster bike shop which is a good thing in my opinion the shop itself is a little hard to find and i wish they had more pavement for test rides theres just a large dirt parking lot apparently a community repair shop is run out of the same space which can make it difficult to figure out who actually works there and whos just hanging around when i went they were understaffed which meant i had to wait around for assistance but the employee i worked with was helpful and didnt pressure or rush me at all they advertise a lot of their bikes on craigslist so you can get an idea of the selection before you go i saw bikes priced from 602000 with the majority 200600 they do accept credit cards but youll have to pay a 3 paypal fee the hours listed here arent accurate according to the sign on their door theyre open 116 wed sun or something like that overall if im looking for a used bike again this would be the first place id go|1
this is probably the best fried chicken ive tasted my whole life i also like that they have sweet potato fries as a side with no additional cost but the chips are pretty terrible dinner and lunch specials mean this place is best value as well|1

i used a 130 group on for shampoo plus they did a good job with the carpets and the exterior though left some watermarks outside would have cost 210 otherwise but they were really hard to get a hold of every time i called to make an appointment nobody picked up i had to drive there to make one and it was about a month later because all the weekends are booked already had to wait a bit because no one is ever at reception i asked them to call me when they were done but no call i went back to check on them to find out they were done after 35 his even then i had to wait outside for someone to talk to because there was no one in reception there was another person there too and he wasnt happy about it either they are ok i will try another place if i need my car cleaned again|0
do buchard and her staff are caring skilled and have always given my dogs the best care possible for over 7 years do buchard has performed regular check ups teeth cleaning and illness diagnosis for both dogs when one of dogs needed some specialized dental care she referred me to the university of gulp rather than trying the procedure herself she cared more about my dog getting the right care than collecting a large fee for treatment she does follow ups she has even called on statutory holidays to make sure everyone is recovering well she loves animals and it shows in her all her interactions with both clients and pets i know my pets have always gotten the best care possible with her|1

i love to shop here dont get me wrong its called the purveyor of fine foods for a reason it is expensive you get what you pay for is not always an acceptable or applicable philosophy however with as it is their store presentation and departments are often impeccable and most definitely aesthetically impressive top five reasons that as this location specifically qualifies as a purveyor of fine foods 1 sit down or pickup sushi bar with a professional sushi chef fresh sushi and sashimi made daily on site 2 gourmet meals to go choose from meals such as marinated bone fresh alaskan salmon marinated pork loins menu varies daily individual plates or group order thanksgiving christmas meals served every season preorder for group orders required 3 large wine department i wine specialist on hand for pairing recommendations or special orders their wine specialists are superior in job experience and expertise 4 artisanal floral department i have never seen any other floral department in any other grocery store compare to the arrangements at this as only a floral company such as cactus flowers compares to their talent 5 exceptional produce they have so many different options also if you need a fruit or vegetable not on the floor they most likely can order it for you honorable mention the bakery department small but fantastic|1
i have yet to recieve a delivery after purchasing my coupon for this service over 3 weeks ago they are very behind on orders and customer service it appears to be like a lottery system now and hopefully one day in the future my green bin will show up i wouldnt use this company if you were in a rush or if you expected consistent reliable service i will repost regard no quality once i receive a delivery|0

i used to work on shaker square and have been to this shop several times and every time ive had an issue with the woman that works there i had even sworn off shopping there but i was recently on a special shopping trip with my 4 year old that was supposed to be fun and this woman was able to ruin it just like she always has she is downright rude and nasty twice now she has even made very demeaning comments to me when i asked for assistance it is true that they have a great selection of toys but her horrible attitude just kills the experience i would never spend my money in such a place again if you go just see for yourself|0

worst aquarium store ever i bought one little yellow finned fish for ex the price of the same one at big als only to discover it had anchor worm 2 days later definitely from the store i put it in a brand new cycled tank i also bought a 22 pearl scale goldfish for a seperate well maintained tank who has had every issue a goldfish can possibly have ever parasites bacterial infections ugliness whatever ive spent 30 there on antibiotics it now has dropsy and is swirling around the tank breathing its last breaths the the thing about incompatible grouping of fish is right they told me to put a goldfish in my tank with everyone else everything from fish to equipment to accessories is overpriced only plus outside the store in the mall there is a nice turtle hanging around a pond of goldfish not totally humane but fun to look at i rate this store one dead fish out of a possible five dead fish who are slowly wasting away|0

never again my sister and i came in here to get a shall ac manicure she chose the pink and white and i did a normal color and polish change on my toes during the manicure i noticed that the jail technician was getting the gel all over my cuticle i asked her if it would come off and she said it would she used a brush with acetone one it to remove it taking with here half of the nail polish that was on my nail i asked her to fix the thumb and index finger because that was the most noticeable and she proceeded to just paint another coat over it instead of starting over which ene vid ably bubbled and chipped within an hour of getting it done while i was looking at the less than professional nail job i noticed that my toe nails look like i painted them myself i mean there was paint all over the cuticle it was uneven and even smudged in places i decided to stop in real quick that day to show them the issue and to schedule an appointment in order for them to fix their errors the manager looked and agreed on the issues and i scheduled my appointment when i got home i told my sister and she told me that she also has a lot of bail problems she did the pink and white shellac and the nails were so oooo bumpy the white was done sloppily and there were numerous little black dots from the file that were very noticeable i told her that i went in there and that she should come with me the next day and let them know we arrived at the nail salon the next morning to an empty shop my sister showed the manager the issue and the manager said there is no problem with yours and i will not fix it while the guy was doing my nails i told my sister that she should go on yelp and other sites and write a review the owner manager stormed up and started yelling at me about how i cant tell her that and that i shouldnt have a problem because they were fixing mine i told her that i was allowed to tell her that she has the option of expressing her opinion wherever she wants that she had a service performed and that she wasnt happy with it and that its her right to do that the manager then goes and this is a direct quote you no talk about that review in my shop i again let her know that for one it was a private conversation been my sister and i and secondly that again its her right to say anything she wants about her dissatisfaction with her service she proceeds to tell me you dont talk personal things in my salon then insane i then told her that as an american citizen i believe that im allowed to say whatever i would like to say in my private conversation with my sister she told me you americans just think your number one i was completely baffled at this point never in my life have i ever been yelled at by a manager for absolutely no reason the worst part was i repeatedly asked her to just please stop talking to me and let me finish my service so i can leave and she just kept marching back and yelling all kinds of crazy things in her broken english tha made zero sense i then asked her to just let me have my money back because i was not enjoying my service she refused she just kept marching back and yelling at us both about how we shouldnt write a review and that we were mean as she was running around yelling at me about having a personal talk about my sister writing a review about the shop online long story short the owner made numerous anti american statement about how we think we are number one and other ignorant statements i recorded some of the conversation and upon finding out that i had her bizarre yelling recorded she demanded i delete it please my sister and i went to the salon right accross the street and told them what happen and literally three other women in the salon shared stories about their horrible experiences at diamond nails bottom line never ever ever go to diamond nails save ur time and money and go to the salon on 83 or anywhere else for that matter|0

from day one of walking into the barre code i couldnt have felt more welcomed and inspired the studio owner and all the instructors are so sweet motivating and make you feel completely at home their offerings of classes are totally off the charts you would be hard pressed not to find a class time to fit into your schedule 6 am noon 530 am and even 730 am classes are offered around the clock all throughout the week they also offer a variety of different barre classes the standard barre code consists of four sets of strength training arms abs glutes and thighs then they have an assortment of cardio barre classes from a kickboxing style brawl to hi it to a heated barre code class requiring you to bring a yoga mat burn the music is incredibly motivating upbeat and changes monthly alway ing keeping your interest the instructors are on the mic for 50 minutes shouting and motivating you like youve never experienced before they challenge you and push you to your limit each and every class you feed off the energy of the girls next to you it truly is such an incredible experience aside from the classes being the best offerings of barre classes ive ever tried the studio is impeccably clean and signing up for classes is an absolute breeze the mind body connect app allows you to sign up for classes about 7 or so days out which allows for planning and insures you get yourself to the studio i couldnt be more grateful for this place the commitment of the instructors to make each class better than the last and the incredible community of women that choose to come here i can not recommend this place enough they also have an incredible new client special which is the perfect way to test out all the classes and see how the barre code can truly bring so much good to your life their north hills location is just as fabulous|1
455 i love this place my mom and i had tried brazilian bakery a few years back and have been wanting to come here ever since very friendly service and they have a good selection of items seriously wish i could have stomach ed a bit of everything it all looked delicious bathroom is also very clean and i thought it was so cute that the servers knew majority of their customers orders as they walked in so theyve got mostly sweet pastries ranging from cakes to sweet crescents but youve also got a side with a deli and cheese if you want them to make you a sandwich they also serve coffee and hot drinks we ended up getting a dessert each and then one to share tiramisu im a lover of tiramisu and this one was a bit light but i loved that my mom would have preferred it to be a bit richer coffee cake excellent im also a coffee lover and this was perfect the taste wasnt too strong but it had the perfect coffee hint to it and a brownie with nuts very rich brownie a bit chewy for my liking but still delicious all together was 8 which i think is pretty reasonable we were stuffed definitely coming back for the crescents and i really recommend you do too|1

im going to be honest ive avoided this place since they opened in july because i was afraid of sticker shock my fiance gets his haircut next door every month and im usually with him last weekend was the pinup pop up event and i was getting antsy waiting around so i reluctantly went in to kitten retro glamour expecting to be let down when i looked at the price tags i totally wasnt for vintage inspired quality clothing this place has some of the best prices ive seen i found a brown faux fur stole that the owner generously placed on hold for me for a week so i could come back to try it on with my wedding dress and it was perfect i plan on coming back after the holidays to try on a few other items kitten retro glamour wont let you down|1
let me start by saying im 27 years old and ive seen my fair share of salons and hairdressers in my day but oh my god i have never been taken care of so well the other hairdresser sat down next to me and we ral ked while i waited they offered refreshments they were very social but beyond that it was the skill love of her job and her passion to learn more and do well that has me enamoured she talked about classes she routinely takes to improve she is the first one to not leave my skin blotchy from dye she used cotton along with the foil to ensure the color and highlights didnt mix she was careful and excited to do a complex color and highlight job i am so flippin impressed i love thus salon i could not think of one bad thing to say i only know basic high school spanish if that and i why made me feel at home i love this place and i highly recommend anyone and everyone to give it a try|1
absolute worse airline ever i have took this airline twice and both times their was a delay to my destination and another delay coming back a week later and did not even try to accommodate any one during check in was a disaster they could not figure out why the system wanted to charge me 10 dollars when i clearly did not have any extra luggage or weight they told me they did not know why the plane is also very small and tight it would be cheaper flying with other airline because they charge for every bag as well|0
they do have a ton of stuff crammed in this store kind of hard to navigate but its not really a buy sell shop its more an antique store things are organized fairly good but prices were quite high although everything i picked up to look at may be 18 different things had no price there was a sign stating to ask about the price if things werent marked but to try to wind through the store for each item to try to find the sales desk was way too cumbersome|0

i really hate to do this since everyone has given this little shop such great praise the bread basket sent me coupons for a long time so while i was visiting my local sunflower market i decided to take a peak in not going in for anything particular just looking around behind the counter is a giant oven and the place smells yeasty of heaven i am pretty sure this place is family owned since there was one single guy in there with his new assistant to help customers i glanced at the bread and they had many kinds pre cut loaf i of honey wheat bread stone ground wheat bread rosemary bread they also had bakery bread im not well adverse in the types of bread there are i believe one was spelt bread and some other types but i could not find just a plain ol french bread im a sucker for french their cinnamon bread looked amazing as did the banana bread dense and dark i bet its dreamy but i didnt purchase it i was more in the mood for something sweet my boyfriend decided to go with the brownie 175 and i picked up a pack of frosted sugar cookies up after our 6 dollar purchase we walked outside back into the heat to give them a try i broke off a piece of sugar cookie and it was very plain and mediocre the frosting was hard and left a waxy film on the roof of my mouth my boyfriend however thought the frosting was too much and was too sweet for the cookie the cookie itself i dont see classified as a sugar cookie very crumble and plain the brownie my boyfriend got reminded me of dunking heinz out of the box brownie mix but with less oil less sugar and more ca key i dunno not impressed at all needless to say we didnt finish these goodies didnt satisfy the sweet tooth if i do go back i will try the banana bread and cinnamon bread may be one of their muffins i saw sitting in the back they gotta be good at bread but cookies and brownies didnt do it for me i|0
had a project car 89 cry si for sale listed on facebook marketplace started getting messages from mike the owner about his interest after exchanging messages for a while he said he wanted it cash in hand a few excuses later of why he never came to pick it up i offered for an additional 150 to bring it to him via car hauler because the car wouldnt start lets talk about that i have various text messages and facebook messenger messages telling him what i thought was wrong what i thought needed to be fixed and in my best opinion how to get the thing running i am moving a family of 4 about 600 miles away for a new job i wont have a garage right away so the project needs to be gone as is just the nature of the beast so here i am at 704 customs in no drove almost 3 hours one way for him to get it we get the car unloaded he brags about dumping 40 grand into a stereo for it just as a beater show car blah blah blah we notice mid transaction that the title was incorrectly filled out by the previous owner so he asks if he can hold 200 of the asking price until the title is fixed for his own protection sure i am at his place of business he had a pocket full of 100s seems to be good for it wrong this all happened on a thursday friday and the following monday i had the title fixed and reprinted 60 of which i never asked for any of that back and mailed out immediately on that monday he got the title the car minus the 200 he owes me here we may est i sent the title out to him on april ith still failed to uphold his measly 200 end of the bargain he dodges phone calls ignores messages ignores facebook blocks people from his page so they cant leave negative reviews telling how awful of a business man he truly is so look him up on google yelp bob facebook etc you can see for yourself what you are getting into with this establishment he has threatened so sue me for selling a car under false pretenses even though i have all the messages to prove that i didnt know exactly what was wrong with the vehicle and i only thought this or that would get it back working he is aggressive unfriendly sends me messages to cuss me out whenever i ask for my money at this point i just want the money to go our separate ways i have since left reviews anywhere and everywhere i can including the bob hopefully your experience is better than the many experiences documented on the many review sites|0

i would recommend this place for the price because it is really cheap the workers there are fast too but my recent experience at the bike joint isnt great about 2 weeks ago i brought my bike to the bike joint for repair because i noticed that my tire was flat so i assumed that there was a crack somewhere on the tire after their inspection they told me i had to get a new tire thats fine i paid 30 after tax and expected the new tire will last me a while no that didnt happen just noticed my tire is flat again i dont know why this happened but i dont know if i should bring it back to the same place again|0

i wish i could give a zero star my husband and i fell homeless and grateful we were at a shelter but we decided to move there after i got a job so we stayed there with the help of my mother in law first the 198 a week sign they had out there is a lie because we paid 268 i had to work and without an id for myself which i had my husband check in he fell ill and ended up in the hospital never had the chance to add me to the lease so the next week when my mother in law paid the payment the lazy office people didnt process her payment so i got locked out and ended to having to spend the night in a casino until visiting hours to see my husband they refused to left me in the following week i got locked out again because my key wouldnt work and the people in the office were so rude to me threw the key back at me and said nothing we can do leave the property so at this point we have given them almost a 1000 but they wont let me in my neighbor got the door unlocked for me and i had to keep my window open so i could slide it so i can get in at this point i rather live in a homeless shelter because at least i was respected when we have paid almost 1000 for three weeks once my husband was released we moved to a co worker we are still trying to get the 50 dollar deposit find somewhere before this place with bugs everywhere still no deposit back i dont understand why it was clean they said 4 to six weeks dont ever stay here dont dont dont make the same mistake we did because we were desperate do research dont ever stay here|0
been taking my cats here for a couple years and have always been easy to deal with and incredibly helpful helping me out even just with info over the phone to advice they have been amazing they arent pushy about getting expensive work done either they give their recommendations in regards to your pets health but also say that things may be helpful but not necessary which makes me feel better knowing they arent trying to make an extra buck and if they do recommend something then it really is necessary really trust these guys 100 and would recommend any day|1

since relocating to this area i have been on the search for a real restaurant that i can take my family to and feel good about taking a night off from the kitchen myself one in which actual food is prepared and served unfortunately all i got here was another swing and a miss our server was friendly but could not really answer the questions that we asked her about the menu or tell us what the charge was for a child to get the buffet we also had to wait for at least 15 minutes for them to figure out our check we had a coupon and they were having an issue with the register they finally figured it out manually which is what they should have done in the first place and figured out their difficulty after we left since no one else was in there on to the food my husband and i got the friday night dinner buffet for just under 10 which included a decaying salad bar the lettuce came straight out of a bag and was slimy and had plenty of brown on every edge they were clearly not going to replace it until some poor soul actually ate what was there all of the veggies looked as if they were bad or going to turn at any second if they actually make anything from scratch here i just would never believe it probably even if i saw it everything had the taste of processed frozen or boxed disco food the mashed potatoes were the flakes out of a box the stuffing tasted like stove top with extra pepper not a real piece of onion or celery to be found the beets were rotting the corn was frozen the meats turkey and meatloaf arrived at the restaurant frozen and heated up in a sea of frozen or canned gravy the only reason i gave crossroads country cafe 2 stars is because i have been served worse once or twice in my life and the people here were at least friendly but as far as dining here you can get the exact same meal much cheaper from your grocery store freezer and cook it in your own microwave|0
we were very happy with the professional services of the gillespie law firm craig is a long time professional and knowledgeable about the laws of the state when we needed a dui specialist he was referred and we are happy we worked with his firm while the outcome was not as we desired those results were mitigated to the degree possible by craig and his staff the law is harsh and unreasonable and lawyers can not be expected to change the law only to take advantage of all of the areas of moderation which are available to clients that is what they did there was not any sugar coating or promises which could not be kept as gillespie did not have control over the court but he knew what to ask and what to recommend to us and those recommendations helped in the overall outcome rob|1

i was so psyched to go to dozens when i knew i would be in pittsburgh i looked up places to go and found this jewel we headed to dozens on a monday afternoon and when we found it i was surprised to see it was so tiny it was a cute place and i was happy to be there we ordered two dozen mini cupcakes in cherry cola vanilla vanilla and black and white they were so cute and just bite sized which is good because i could sample all three and not feel guilty the girl behind the counter was practically asleep when we arrived and yawned as we placed our order she then proceeded to say its gonna take me a while when we ordered 2 dozen of the tiny treats why was it going to take so long i was a little disappointed to see only 3 of many flavors and had hoped to try some of the other creative flavors i am guessing it is hard to have so many in stock on a daily basis though for future reference the cherry cola one is delicious great prices yummy treats and you can even mark the spot where you are taking the cupcakes on a big map they also sell tees and other items check out dozens if you are in the squirrel hill area anytime soon|1
i made the mistake of going into this subway just 20 minutes ago as i walk in i was created by an elderly middle eastern that had food in his mouth i wait my turn and the elderly man hops up and runs behind the counter with food of some sort still on his cheek he grabs my bread and cheese then wipes the food from his cheek then grabs my meat not pleased he throws the meat on the sandwich and slides it to the next guy i tell the guy i want onions and lots of olives he sprinkles onions and puts on about 8 slices of olives on my foot long i ask for more he puts on two more slices i say sir i will pay for extra olives and im fine with that but i want extra olives he responds i cant man then nods to the elderly guy i never imagined i would live to see the day that black olives were such a coveted resource that i would be unable to attain them with american currency accepting defeat i pay for my foot long only to be able to gain the contact information on this specific subway but on the bright i am excited because apparently the cans of black olives in my pantry are so valuable that i might be able to sell them and buy my own subway|0
i went to this shop because it was cheap and had mixed reviews but in my opinion i love this place they were slow when i went in but was seated right away to do my nails and only problem i had was he cut my finger with the electric buffer thing but other than that amazing selection of colors and tips of all different colors not just white and then got my eyebrows waxed and it was amazing she was careful and didnt rush made sure they were perfect then i got a scalp massage which was amazing go here if you want a good full set and eyebrows done|1

prices were good didnt have to wait for a table after stopping in with my family on a late saturday afternoon however i kept it pretty simple with the chicken parm and was thoroughly disappointed i think chef boarded made the sauce it was that bland and distilled of much taste i am willing to go back for their lunchtime sandwiches on a recommendation and because so many people seem to like the place but it may just be they havent had decent italian food in az much just because its got a decent italian name for the restaurant does not mean its worth a visit|0
im done with this place i come here for oil changes they tell me it will be one hour and its always two today i bought frozen food that has now all thawed out im pissed jiffy lube from now on|0

my friends and i came in the other night for late night drinks they accommodated us perfectly with a table and bottle service the staff and management were amazing we will definitely be coming back|1
i have driven by this place a hundred times and didnt want to go in because it looks a little run down from the outside i finally got take out last night and the food was amazing im not kidding so yummy i got pan seared dumplings biq noodles and a slice of raw raspberry cheesecake it was so very good they are clearly expert in the area of vegan foods so much better than going to a non vegan restaurant and having them try to accommodate you i would have given 5 stars but the wait time was crazy she told me on the phone that it would be one hour what ok fine we waited the hour and my husband went to go grab my food they still werent done and it took another 30 minutes i feel that 15 hours is waaaay too long to wait for one meal this is why i gave 4 stars i will try it again due to the food being so good and hope that they were just having a rough night|1
as good as it gets jonathan and alex did a fantastic job on our castillo tile which are notorious for being finicky jonathan handled the entire job 1650 soft with a high attention to detail all communication was very professional and both were willing to explain everything their process the best example of them being a great business was when i wasnt satisfied with a certain area jonathan explained why the tile appeared inconsistent and volunteer to redo the area with additional resources at no charge even though it was a more difficult process than i originally asked for a all around|1
great visit with do levi and his staff very attentive and friendly do levi is great and has a great office excellent location as well|1

i was scheduled to see do a urge for high blood pressure urine retention and more i arrived at 1045 am only to be told that my appointment was scheduled for 220 am not 11 am i went all the way home in the freezing cold rain before returning to the doctor office i was 10 minutes late due to construction on the highway and two cars pulled over on the side of the road because of an apparent fender bender the receptionist told me that she would have to check with the doctor to see if she would still see me because i was 10 minutes late after speaking with do a urge the receptionist came out to tell me that do a urge refused to see me even though i was experiencing major health issues this doctor does not care about patients she does not have an ounce of compassion in her bones to turn away a sick patient who has already been to your office once for being 10 minutes late is ridiculous and says a lot about her care choose another doctor if your looking for compassion and someone how cares|0
lousy service i was the only one in line my order was filled except or one item the cook prepared 3 other items for nobody that was in line no nobody in the restaurant after the cook filled the three other items for nobody then the cook prepared my order while my food got cold i got a refund and went to el bravo mexican food which is the best food in the entire valley panda express is bad and dirty|0

my parents and i have been loyal patrons of this restaurant for years we love the food and have dined here around 30 times celebrating birthdays toasting anniversaries and spending evenings with friends on sunday september 14 we came in for dinner this was our last dinner together before i left to start a new job in spain so clearly this was an important occasion for us this turned out to be a huge mistake all of the great times we have had here were spoiled by a truly awful experience the service was absolutely horrible while the food was good as always it just couldnt make up for the treatment we received this is the first time we have ever been to a restaurant where the waitress abandoned the table never to come back the waitress forgot our appetizer we understand that this happens sometimes not a big deal by the time she remembered we told her to skip it as we were receiving our entrees at that point we werent rude or even angry we just didnt want the appetizer anymore she came back to the table with the cheese and that was the last time we saw her another woman brought our bread also forgotten halfway into our entrees then when we finished our meal we sat and waited until finally yet another woman came over and asked if we needed anything we asked what had happened to our first waitress and were told much to our confusion said that she was upset that she had forgotten our appetizer and wouldnt be back the woman mentioned something along the lines of well thats how young people are really wouldnt it have been more appropriate to make up for the minor mishap and step up the service like at least checking to see that our entrees were good instead the level of service took a nosedive we asked to speak to a manager who also happens to be the owner of the restaurant and the woman went to check upon her return imagine our surprise when she said that the manager was aware of the situation but couldnt leave the kitchen and refused to see us note that there was almost no one else in the restaurant i cant imagine the kitchen was that busy we are dumbfounded and disgusted by the lack of respect we received as customers at this restaurant because the restaurant offered no apology and no remedy to the situation a small mistake snowballed into the most appalling service we have ever received we love the food but we can get good food anywhere an integral part of going to a restaurant is the service and it is completely lacking here for that reason we wont be coming back may be eddie should learn a thing or two about customer service edit after posting this review i received this comment from eddie wow been there 30 previous time with great results and no yelp reviews one bad experience and you blast us on yelp there is a word for that unbelievable one bad experience was not the issue eddie it was the complete lack of respect for your customers a complete lack of intelligence on how to run a business in the service industry and the complete lack of knowledge to know that to make it in this business you apologize for mistakes made on the part of your restaurant you have nothing but furthered my point that you have absolutely no respect for your patrons that is the reason we will never be back|0

i called al when the ac in a rental property i own stopped working when he went to have a look i could not be there my tenants met with him got an estimate and paid for the repair with their own money the word repair is in quotation marks because what al did was simply recharge the system with freon although it was obvious that the system was leaking he charged well over 300 dollars for this and disappeared i had to reimburse my tenants and explain to them that they had fallen for the oldest trick in the hvac book in a week the ac was back to blowing hot air and al was nowhere to be found i am attaching the estimate al provided which shows black on white that he was aware that there may be a leak in the system and yet he went ahead and charged it freon all the same in short if you like the aftertaste of being scammed give al a call if not i suggest you stay away|0

dont ever go here if i could save anyone from anything it would be to not go here they have terrible customer service i went in to have a bridge repaired over a holiday since my regular dentist was closed they got me in the following morning and after waiting an hour to get in when my appointment was at 8 they did unnecessary rays and then finally came in to do the job when i had explained that this maryland bridge fell out over a year ago and that it happens with these types of bridges and that all it needs to be re cemented after listening to him talk down to me like i was some child and need to get an implant and not to bargain for an implant which i explain i didnt have the money for he finally started now as i said before ive had this procedure done twice and i expect it to take at least an hour for them to fix it took this guy ten minutes not even 12 hours later and my bridge fell out again i called them back upset because it shouldnt have fallen out so soon they told me that they wouldnt refund me for the work they did because according to them they did everything correct even though it fell out the same day they fixed it they offered to redo it for free later that week and i refused because why waste anymore time there please do not go here if you need any sort of bridge repair these people suck|0
i was there last week with a friend for a burger before a movie they said they ran out of tomatoes it was about 745 am not crowded and staff was just chatting behind the counter with each other i asked the cashier why didnt someone go across the street to harris teeter and buy more tomatoes no one seemed to think it was a big deal i should have asked to speak to the manager who should not have allowed this to happen whats next they run out of fries very disappointed|0

arrived at around 730pm on a thursday with some friends and waited for about 5 minutes to be seated i dont eat italian very often but im glad that one of my girlfriends picked this place to try out we ordered the rice ball and fried calamari for starters though they were both good i did have much higher expectations from the hyped up reviews for our main we ordered pizza the new school gnocchi and the trina crib rigatoni my friends and i agreed that the pasta was the best out of everything we ordered the rigatoni is light made with a lot of fresh vegetables a great summer pasta the new school gnocchi was my favourite it was pan fried and cooked perfectly through though the portion leaned toward the smaller side we ended off with the tiramisu which was good as well as for the service they were friendly and attentive will definitely be back to try their other dishes|1

if i could give this office a 0 i would with all the complaints they get about the front desk receptionists you i think they i address that issue i have seen do safe ar a couple of times now for cos and every single time i am rushed out without any questions being answered she orders me more and more blood work every time and never addresses the results or tells me how to deal with this i called today and got the busy signal until 130 they leave for lunch early and stay late or at least they turn the phones off early and turn them back on later because i have called so many times around 1145 or 130 and the message still comes up i asked the receptionist if i would be able to see another doctor at the office just for a second opinion and she rudely told me they dont change providers unless its an extenuating circumstance she then asked why i wanted to change i stated all the reasons above she was quiet for a few minutes i assumed she was looking for an open app for me and then said well ill talk to the other doctors to see if theyll accept you or not give me your phone number and ill call back i couldnt believe how unprofessional she was i work in a medical office as well and if a patient has a preference for which doctor they see we accommodate i am young and have cos my grandmother died of ovarian cancer i am just trying to be on top of things and talk to a professional about my situation these people clearly only care about getting people in and out i will not be returning|0
ive been to this mcdonalds a million times but its the first time i really want to say this hoping mcdonald is reading the manager is really nice but i think either the staff are trained badly or its just a bad case of lord of the flies there its a sunday morning we used the kiosk to order and the receipt was jammed inside i walked over to the counter and asked the first person to help me to which she responded yeah the machine is jammed so you dont get a receipt but i will get your food i tried twice to explain to her that i could see my receipt in the slot but she just kept giving me the same respond a second person some teenager with a frown clearing showing how much she didnt want to be there chimed in with mam that is not your receipt there is no receipt and we cant print another one for you what she meant was its just a stupid receipt and stop asking us i already know its not true because this happened before and i got one re printed frankly i really didnt care about the receipt its the general laziness of either of them walking back there to get the someone with a key bit that probably bothered me more never mind that legally they have to give a customer a receipt when asked while i was waiting to speak with the manager a customer walked up and said i ordered two sausage egg muffin i and these have neither sausage or egg in them at that point he manager just arrived to the front with all 3 of the servers gawking at the meatless eggless sandwiches with no clue what to do and me standing there waiting for a receipt its almost comical of course i got my receipt exactly where i saw it stuck inside and many apologies from the manager and the guy got two new sandwiches and happy just makes you wonder if the manager is doing everything why they even need the others one thing about mcdonalds food is that its consistent its not gourmet but it serves it purpose just unfortunate they could find consistently with it people to work there its the restaurant business i guess by the way its a 24 hour location so the info for the restaurant needs to be changed|0

i had an excellent experience with cargo cabbie when i moved to toronto from the us i had a very stressful move in the us sold a house packed everything arrived in toronto one day late cargo cabbie was awesome they adjusted my arrival date for a small fee they completely accommodated my needs i arrived with a haul and they unloaded the entire thing with great skill and care for my belongings they assembled my bed and dresser and when a piece was missing which was my error they gave me advice for what to do to get it fixed they worked quickly but carefully i am using them again for another move to a storage unit this time i will have them use their truck since it will be most economical they charge a fair price and they will deliver to any storage you choose not just their companys storage location one other company would not empty the haul but cargo cabbie would they made my move on the toronto end painless and a positive experience they earned their tip a friend of mine hired their company to move his office and they did a wonderful job for his office as well i recommend them without reservation|1

this is my last morning here i wanted to do a quick review this hotel pretty much makes me cringe upon arrival to the hotel after driving 5 hours and just ready to get into my room that was already reserved the front desk was not helpful nor friendly the process took way longer than it should have limo he never greeted me he never had a conversation with me he never even really said anything in regards to me checking in to the point that i am like wif is going on do i even have a reservation here is this the right place does he see my name he looked at his little outdated computer then walked over to two clipboards flipped through some papers back to his computer no words i finally say did you find my reservation he acted like he had it the entire time he then told me i needed a credit card and i told him the credit cards used to book the room on the reservation he was having a hard time locating even though he said he had was the one to be used and i had to explain that to him twice he walked back and forth a few more times eventually he grabbed a couple key cards and was trying to activate them and i was just thinking thank god still he is not talking and im still unsure of wif is going on i ask him what room i am in and he only says i will write it on the key card envelope as soon as he handed them to me i went out the front door to my car to locate the room and shaking my damn head as i went i work with the public everyday and have nearly a decade experience in client services and its not that damn hard to be friendly how was your drive is this your first stay here is there anything we can get for you etc i was bummed that this place didnt have a swimming pool but thinking about it now even if it did i would not go swimming in it i had viewed photos and read these reviews about the look of the hotel and so i knew that it wasnt going to be that nice by default i had to stay here since the other hotels included in this business trip were already booked full this hotel may be had 6 cars including mine the entire time in the parking lot if even that at all times the room is seriously outdated the carpet needs replaced and makes the room look dingy green worn out carpet gold bedspread and brown curtains blech it was moderately clean though i will give them that the bed was pretty comfortable however for a queen bed you receive 3 small square pillows equivalent to the size of a decorative pillow for a bed or couch the strangest smallest pillows if i were having to share this bed with a travel mate we would need to ask for about 3 more pillows there was no little binder in the room that told you about places to go things to do places to eat etc at all i have been to this area some but there are so many choices that it could become overwhelming for those that have never been here i have my laptop and was able to research and find some really good dinner spots but of no help from the hotel i didnt even want to ask the front desk for recs after my check in experience i also felt like the few guests i saw here really creeped me out to the point i didnt want to even leave my room to get ice once i was in for the evening or i could see into the window down the hallway when id pull into the parking lot after dinner and if there were anyone there i would wait i am not a paranoid person and i am perfectly okay going to places by myself as a woman but when you get hit on or creepy vibes by two separate people on two separate occasions just by walking through your hotel that is not okay and made me feel unsafe the lack of other guests in the hotel made me more aware of my surroundings i would feel safer if there were more people staying in this hotel each day when i returned from training before going to dinner there were like homeless people sitting outside by the door i entered i just dont get this hotel its in a prime location the other hotels near it have filled up parking lots etc and this one is empty and awful theres a few restaurants you can walk to from here and its across from a business park there is a lot of potential for this hotel i could overlook the appearances and the creepy guests if the customer service had been 1000x better than what it has been customer service will make or break your business especially when its customer service based my suggestion is to spend a little more money and stay somewhere nicer after writing my final review i must edit i went to take a shower before i got on the road and there was barely any water coming out of the shower or sink i called front desk and she said she was unaware of my request for late check out at noon and that she would have told me the water was turned off between 113pm and there was like nothing she felt apologetic about or anything do not ever stay here run sleep in your car do anything but stay here|0
no idea how this place has such high reviews service was friendly thats about it the food was extremely slow took 50 minutes to get our pasta it wasnt even busy only two tables inside and four on the patio mostly empty when the pasta finally did arrive it was watery and bland tasted like microwaved frozen dinner most disappointing pasta ive ever had|0
horrible experience i went there to wash my car and everything was going smooth then when it was time to use the spot free rinse it wouldnt spray mind you the timer is ticking so im being charged more and more to figure it out eventually i gave up and moved my vehicle to the next spot to see if that pump was working nope and there goes another 2 driving away from that place mad and knowing my vehicle looks worse now with water spots i called and left a voicemail explaining what happened i said they could keep my money i just want a free wash to get rid of the water spots no call back this place sucks|0
i placed a special order of cotton candy for my upcoming wedding favors i loved all the flavor and color options and each piece came perfectly packaged and labeled with our own sticker the ultimate low fuss wedding favor and priced so very reasonably i know they will be a hit this weekend|1
so the service was terrible the haircut and color was terrible everything sucked i posted a photo previously of andres rude response to my review from the moment i walked in to the moment i left andre would not stop talking moaning whining about how difficult and apparently dreaded my hair was firstly my hair is thick curly and dense your e going to find tangles i dont wash my hair every other day like most people sure i have tangles dreads in my hair if i can get them out myself so can he instead he made me de tangle my own hair which took an entire 45 seconds the entire experience was filled with huffing puffing and making side comments about how thick and tangled my hair was of course your e not going to be able to brush my hair out in 5 seconds he responded saying i was trying to pull the race card but noi was pulling the you dont know how to work on any other hair but straight card the guy is so unprofessional and clearly has not ventured out with different hair textures cant believe i wasted money on his crappy job and if your e someone who isnt white with thin frail short hair then dont even bother going there his work sucked and his attitude sucked even more|0

great experience set up an appointment for an evaluation and first time service on a tuesday afternoon and was given a one hour appointment window on thursday morning the owner vendor rick called when he was on his way and arrived on time he walked the house inside and out asked a few questions made recommendations and got the service done quickly he also came up with a brilliant idea for ridding myself of a rat that has been nesting above my bathroom vent for the past few summers and that no other pest control company has had suggested he will be back soon to take care of it enjoyed the pleasant conversation and great customer service rates are reasonable|1
i usually love this store and i would rate the clothes and accessories 4 stars however the experience i had today was very unpleasant when my friend and i walked into the store we picked up items to try on i had just picked up a dress and the sales clerk said from across the room loudly you wont look good in that color im just being honest she continued to explain to me how i wouldnt look good in it and how she tried it on the other day and it didnt work either i was very embarrassed and humiliated im fine not being greeted when i walk into a store but im not okay with being insulted across the room it wasnt like i was trying on the clothes and asked for her opinion i was mortified other customers noticed and left my friend and i immediately put the items we had in our hands down and left my friend did have something she was going to purchase but decided against it after what she said the sales clerk didnt even notice the business she lost and all the unhappy customers that left the funny thing is my friend and i joked i probably wouldve bought that dress but i dont want to spend my money somewhere ill be insulted at|0
ive taken all my vehicles to saa and moon since 1997 i dont go anywhere else honest as the day is long and hot in arizona you might not get the little conveniences like a loaner car or a nice waiting room but what you will get are honest mechanics who are detail oriented and knowledgable i used to have an antique truck and moon and company were the only ones who touched it the truck ran perfectly while i had it so do all of my vehicles dont go anywhere else with your vehicle not matter what make and model you have oh and if moon cant fix your vehicle he will tell you but that wont happen i highly recommend this business even if it costs you a little inconvenience|1
